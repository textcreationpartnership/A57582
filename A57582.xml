            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT was the Saying of Chriſt, <hi>As I Hear, I Judge.</hi> I hope, that <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Example in that Caſe, will be ſuch a Bond on every one that may concern themſelves touching this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> as that I may have no juſt Occaſion, to reflect on any <hi>Chriſtian-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor;</hi> even as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> once did, on thoſe of his own Sect;
<note n="‖" place="margin">Joh. 7.51.</note> 
               <hi>Doth our Law Judge any Man, before it Hear him?</hi> In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> may meet with ſo much <hi>Juſtice,</hi> at leaſt from <hi>True</hi> (if not from all <hi>Pretended</hi>) <hi>Friends,</hi> 'tis now brought to Light. And though ſome amongſt the People, termed (in Deriſion) <hi>Quakers,</hi> appearing to ſtand as <hi>Neuters</hi> in the preſent Controverſy amongſt them, (not knowing the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Orderly Proceeding</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:57559:3"/>others) may conclude, <hi>That 'tis an Untimely Birth:</hi> Yet let ſuch know, that the Moderation of thoſe, who are concerned in the Publication hereof, hath for many Years paſt been manifeſted,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Diviſions amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have been at leaſt <hi>Eight Years</hi> encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Height they now are at.</note> by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring as much as in them did lye, (as hereafter will more largely appear) that thoſe ſmall Differences, which at firſt ſeemed but like unto <hi>little Sparks,</hi> might not ariſe unto ſo <hi>great a Flame,</hi> as they now are. And were it not ſo, that many Meetings of the ſaid <hi>People,</hi> for the Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> in divers Parts of the Nation, have been entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with frequent <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition;</hi> and in particular, that both <hi>Prieſt, Profeſſor,</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> have become Eye and Ear-Witneſſes, of ſuch <hi>Rude</hi> and <hi>Unchriſtian-like Deportments;</hi> as of late have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, by many ſpeaking at once in their Publick-Meeting, within the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> before many Hundreds; by which the Meeters have been reputed as in an <hi>Uproar,</hi> and their Meeting-Houſe accounted rather a <hi>Stage of Scolding,</hi> than a <hi>Place for Worſhip of God:</hi> It might not as yet have been brought to Light, without ſome further Endeavour, to have ſought a Reconciliation, if ſo be the leaſt Hopes ſhould have been given of its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. But being void of all ſuch Hopes; Now ſo it is, that ſo great a Concern of Conſcience lyes on many, to encourage the Publication hereof, as that we can no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb facs="tcp:57559:3"/>forbear; leſt it ſhould be reputed, <hi>That the Doctrine and Life of Chriſtianity, were wholly Extinct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the afore-ſaid People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Deſire now is, That the <hi>Reader</hi> may ſeriouſly weigh the <hi>Four</hi> following <hi>Notations,</hi> and the <hi>Obſervations</hi> thereon; and then 'twill eaſily be ſavour'd, at what Door the <hi>Publick Diſorders</hi> have entred; and whether or no, they are not the very Birth of ſome Politick, Unchriſtian-like Contrivance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Many in that City retain their <hi>Antient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> for <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> (Two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Honourable Labourers in the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Converſations</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> I have not known or underſtood to be <hi>Exceeded in Godlineſs,</hi> by any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Man whatſoever;) and on that Foot, are accounted ſuch as <hi>Joyn to Separates,</hi> or a <hi>Separate Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>Term</hi> or <hi>Nick-Name</hi> ſometimes is; becauſe ſome <hi>Upſtarts</hi> and <hi>Innovators</hi> (Adherents to <hi>George Fox)</hi> have been pleaſed to diſown the ſaid <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> though they could not juſtly Charge them with Evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In a Paper given forth by an <hi>Eminent Preacher,</hi> (and Oppoſer of <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon;</hi> whoſe Name I omit, for the Reaſons herein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned) thus directed, viz. <hi>To God's Friends
<pb facs="tcp:57559:4"/>every where, concerning the preſent Separates, and their Spirit,</hi> 'tis thus ſaid: <hi>Let not this Spirit be reaſoned with; enter not into Propoſals and Articles with it: but feed it with Iudgment; that is <hi>God's</hi> Decree. So may the Souls that are deceived, come by the Right Door into the Heavenly Vnity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſame Perſon that writ as aforeſaid, was alſo concerned in a Paper ſubſcribed by <hi>Charles Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall,</hi> and <hi>Sixty-Five</hi> more, given forth at <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi> his Chamber, the <hi>12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
               </hi> Day of the <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
               </hi> Moneth, <hi>1677.</hi> wherein 'tis thus writ, with Relation to <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon: <hi>Therefore, Brethren, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſtand up in the Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>God,</hi> for the Teſtimony of Truth, againſt that Wrong, Iealous, Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Dividing Spirit: And where they come, warn them in the Name of the Lord, to go home, and not go thus up and down to offer their Gifts.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The very ſame Perſon, that writ as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid thus, <hi>That is God's Decree;</hi> did alſo ſome Years paſt threaten, <hi>That <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſhould be as an Anvil to beat upon;</hi> meaning with Reſpect to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Differences.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57559:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>My <hi>Obſervations</hi> now are; That in as much as the Meeting at <hi>Briſtol</hi> hath become as an <hi>Anvil,</hi> whereon many <hi>Apoſtates</hi> or <hi>Innovators</hi> (Oppoſers of <hi>John Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi>) have, in a <hi>Diſorderly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> frequently beat; it may not rationally be taken to be the Fruit of a Politick, Unchriſtian-like Contrivance, in the beſt Senſe. And that albeit they have been apt to ſtamp their rude Diſcourſes, and ſevere Judgments in the <hi>Name of the Lord;</hi> reſuſing to reaſon with ſuch againſt whom they ſtrike, or in a <hi>Chriſtian Spirit</hi> to treat of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; yet therein I am fully perſwaded, that they act rather from the Line of <hi>Another,</hi> than <hi>Their own:</hi> And not only ſo, but from the Line ſuch an one as hath taken Liberty to <hi>Violate</hi> that, which he would <hi>Impoſe</hi> (as by a Decree from <hi>God</hi>) on others. For though he Imperatively thus ſaid, as aforeſaid; <hi>Let not this Spirit be reaſoned with; Enter not into Propoſals and Articles with it: but feed it with Iudgment; that is God's Decree:</hi> Yet he himſelf did (a few Moneths after) accompany <hi>George Fox</hi> to the City of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and there entred into <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, Propoſals</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> with ſuch as owned <hi>John Story,</hi> though termed a <hi>Separate,</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Spirit;</hi> which by the Scope of his Writing, may reaſonably be taken by thoſe, who underſtand his Meaning (by theſe his words, <hi>viz. <hi>This Spirit</hi>) To be an Acting contrary to his own Counſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57559:5"/>
            <p>When I compare this with theſe kinds of Declarations, frequently publiſh't amongſt the aforeſaid People; <hi>viz. <hi>Let us Exclude the Reaſoning, the Wiſdom, and the Iealouſie; and let us have an Eye to the Brethren:</hi>
               </hi> Further inſinuating, as if <hi>God</hi> had ordained Miniſters amongſt them, that are to <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> for the <hi>Body,</hi> and common Members of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (as the Printed Terms are:) I cannot but be full of Jealouſie, that theſe Things have a Tendency, to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate <hi>Submiſſion</hi> without <hi>Conviction,</hi> to nurture up <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> inſtead of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and to introduce <hi>Bondage</hi> inſtead of <hi>Freedom in Chriſt,</hi> as much as ever was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cover of a <hi>Black-Coat,</hi> in the Dark Night of <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> where this Maxime, <hi>viz. <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion,</hi>
               </hi> is known to be true, with reſpect to a Zealous Obſervation of what the Clergy have impoſed and taught.</p>
            <p>What is already ſignified, may give ſome little Taſte of <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> or <hi>Innovation,</hi> unto ſuch as have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Primitive Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>True Chriſtian-Quaker,</hi> (or <hi>Children of Light,</hi> for ſo we were called in the Beginning:) But yet, 'tis with me a little to treat of one other grand <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy,</hi> or <hi>Innovation,</hi> viz. <hi>Iudging the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Cauſe, without Hearing the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As before is ſignified, 'Twas the Saying of Chriſt, <hi>As
<pb facs="tcp:57559:5"/>I Hear, I Judge:</hi> But yet I am a Witneſs, that <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> or <hi>Envy,</hi> or that which is worſe, hath ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, as that the <hi>True Chriſtian-Quaker</hi> hath been judged and cenſured, (by ſuch as retain that <hi>Name,</hi> but not his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>) when

<note place="margin">John 16.30.</note> its to me a real Confirmation, that a Pretence to Life, Power, and Diſcerning of Spirits, cannot be ſufficient Plea, to juſtify a Practice contrary to that Example: And therefore, ſince I know, that ſuch a Pretence hath been the only <hi>Plea</hi> for that Practice; I conclude it no better, than the <hi>Fruit of Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Envy,</hi> or that which is worſe. <hi>Ignorance</hi> in thoſe who have believed, that outward Miniſters are Ordained of <hi>God,</hi> amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to See for the Body, and Hear for the Body; and on that Foot, ſigne and glory in other <hi>Men's Lines, made ready to their Hands,</hi> whether they know any thing of the Truth thereof, or no. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> or that which is worſe, in ſuch an one, as hath uſed both Acquired and Natural Parts, from the Strength of Reaſon, Teſtimonies of Scriptures, Arguments from the
<pb facs="tcp:57559:6"/>Light of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Citations out of Antient and Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well as Examples of Antient Fathers to convince ſome Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> of their Errors; and yet imperatively ſignify, <hi>To God's Friends every where,</hi> (as before is cited) on this wiſe: <hi>Let not this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be reaſoned with; enter not into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals and Articles with it: but feed it with Iudgment; that is God's Decree.</hi> And indeed, the Endeavours of ſome have taken ſuch an Effect, as that the abuſed Parties Readineſs to abide a <hi>Hearing,</hi> before a competent Number of Perſons, equally to be choſen, if any one had Matter of Evil Fact, or Falſe Doctrine to lay to their Charge, would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; but inſtead thereof, a Perſevering to term them <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>rending Spirits,</hi> without evidencing wherein: Which is far ſhort of that <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which appeared in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> when he directed the <hi>Jewiſh Informers</hi> againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> to Accuſe him of Wickedneſs, if there be any in him.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things conſidered, What ingenious <hi>Reader</hi> can conclude, that Perſons ſo qualifyed, are of any better Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than thoſe <hi>Perſecuting Jews</hi> were of, unto whom the aforeſaid <hi>Feſtus,</hi> on the Behalf of Perſecuted <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid:
<note n="‖" place="margin">Acts 25.16.</note> 
               <hi>It is not the Manner of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to deliver any Man to Dye, before that he which is Accuſed, have the Accuſers Face to Face; and have
<pb facs="tcp:57559:6"/>Licence to anſwer for himſelf, concerning the Crime laid againſt him.</hi> And though the Teſtimony of <hi>Feſtus</hi> runs not parallel, with reſpect to the taking away of the Natural Life; yet ſeveral Inſtances might be produced, to manifeſt, that there are amongſt the People termed <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſuch as practiſe (ſo far as in them lyes) the bringing a Death upon the Good Name, and Reputation of the True <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving Opportunity to know, <hi>Whether they pretend to Accuſe of Matter of Evil Fact, or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things conſidered, puts me in mind to note, That one great Part of the Matter of Controverſie, is touching <hi>John Story;</hi> who, in Publick Meeting for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, hath (in my Hearing) been accuſed for a <hi>Falſe Prophet;</hi> and when the Accuſer hath been deſired to prove him ſo, the Anſwer hath been, <hi>He is of a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Spirit; <hi>and therefore, a Falſe Prophet:</hi>
               </hi> But when in Anſwer, it hath been ſaid, (as of late it hath) <hi>Bring forth, and prove Matter of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Fact, or Falſe Doctrine againſt him, and we will diſown him;</hi> then nothing of that Nature hath been brought forth, much leſs proved againſt him. Which conſidered, I rationally infer, That ſuch <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker,</hi> whom in this Preface I intend, are guilty of one other <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,</hi> or <hi>Innovation,</hi> in not admitting to be put in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Rule of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall know
<pb facs="tcp:57559:7"/>them by their Fruits;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7.16.</note> meaning, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declares, ſuch as were <hi>Falſe Prophets:</hi> And that they may the better evade the Rule preſcribed as by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſometimes affirm, <hi>That a Good Cauſe may be ill managed, and a bad Cauſe well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged:</hi> Thereby inſinuating into Ignorant People, that though <hi>John Story,</hi> and his Friends have managed their Cauſe well, whil'ſt their Oppoſers have managed their Cauſe but ill; yet that <hi>John Story,</hi> and his Friends are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Bad Spirits,</hi> and their Oppoſers Perſons of <hi>Right Spirits.</hi> And for my own part, I no way doubt, but that this ſort of Argumentation hath become a Defence, and Cover for <hi>Falſe Certificates, Lyes</hi> and <hi>Slanderous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations,</hi> whereby ſome have been proſelyted to oppoſe the Truth it ſelf. Oh, great Abomination!</p>
            <p>If <hi>Living Well,</hi> and holding forth nothing but <hi>Sound Doctrine,</hi> ſhall not be brought to the Meaſuring Line of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> What Defence can there be againſt a <hi>Slanderous Tongue?</hi> And if <hi>Evil Practices,</hi> and <hi>Unſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> (pretended to be publiſh't in the <hi>Name of God</hi>) ſhall admit of this <hi>Cover, he is, notwithſtanding, of a Good Spirit:</hi> A little Religion, and common Senſe, will give an Underſtanding, of what <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> and <hi>Groſs Darkneſs</hi> may be introduced under thoſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>'Tis then eaſily to be diſcerned, that if the Envy of a Proud Man, that ſeeks Lordſhip over the Conſciences of
<pb facs="tcp:57559:7"/>others, do but once put (to ſpeak comparatively) the <hi>Bare-Skin</hi> upon the <hi>Back</hi> of a <hi>Friend in Truth,</hi> there will not be wanting a Company of Ignorant, or Envious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ready to <hi>bite</hi> and <hi>devour him;</hi> and to ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad <hi>Certificates of Defamation</hi> (Right or Wrong) amongst <hi>Enemies,</hi> as well as <hi>Friends;</hi> according to the Example given by <hi>G.

<pb facs="tcp:57559:9"/>Light</hi> are led: I now come to ſignify, that the further Deſign of this <hi>Preface,</hi> is chiefly to Anſwer the Three following <hi>Queries,</hi> which (on the Peruſal of the <hi>enſuing Treatiſe</hi>) I am ſenſible (from Diſcourſe already had) may ariſe in the Breasts of ſome, called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>I. Why haſt thou omitted to mention the Names of ſome Perſons, and Authors of ſome Books, and Papers reflected on, in this Treatiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>II. Why haſt thou treated on Principles, held forth by the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> ſince many Books have already been given forth by ſome amongſt them, treating on many (if not all) of thoſe Things, which thou haſt done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>III. Whether thy Publiſhing this Treatiſe in Print, may not in probability, give unto others a Knowledge of the Differences amongſt us; and ſo obſtruct the Encreaſe of our Meetings, and the Gathering of ſome (yet walking in the Broad Way) into the true Faith; and cauſe many already gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereunto, to ſtumble and fall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I ſhall make direct Anſwer to theſe <hi>Queries,</hi> 'tis needful to inform the <hi>Reader</hi> of ſome Things, (rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Orderly Proceeding, and Conſtraint of Spirit) which
<pb facs="tcp:57559:9"/>(being conſidered) may be well taken for a <hi>Juſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> thus to appear in Print; and not only ſo, but may render the direct Anſwers more ſatisfactory: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I do firſt proceed to ſignifie, that in the Year <hi>1678.</hi> the <hi>Religious Differences,</hi> amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> were ſo publickly manifeſted, that ſeveral of my Brethren ſeemed not only grievouſly burthened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; but alſo concern'd, that the Things which became their <hi>Burthen,</hi> might be ſtated in <hi>Writing,</hi> and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to ſuch amongſt them, who (as was ſuppoſed) might be Inſtruments to put a Stop thereto. This being ſeveral times treated on by ſome, I was deſired (and at length it became my Concern of Conſcience) to put <hi>Pen</hi> to <hi>Paper</hi> on that Subject; which accordingly I did, until at length I compleated an <hi>Hiſtorical Manuſcript,</hi> conſiſting of Three Parts.</p>
            <p>In the Firſt Part is manifeſt, <hi>A Part of thoſe Things, wherein the Faithful were at Unity; and by what Wayes and Means that Unity came to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Second Part are cited, <hi>Many Papers, Epiſtles, Teſtimonies, Proceedings and Practices, which were the Effects of Diſunion, Separation and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Third Part, <hi>Certain Doctrines are treated on, and that Senſe manifeſted, wherein they have been and are received, believed and owned, amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:57559:10"/>the Children of Light; who (being not affected to leave that Teacher, which cannot be removed into a Corner, to follow the Dictates of ſuch Men, whoſe Doctrines and Practices do manifeſt them fallible) have, and do keep their Place and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in the Unchangeable Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the ſaid <hi>Manuſcript</hi> was prepared, Four Friends (whereof my ſelf was One) writ unto <hi>George Fox,</hi> and Two other Perſons, eminent amongſt the ſaid People; and therein laid down many Particulars, relating to Doctrine, Diſcipline and Practice, <hi>Printed, Written, Publiſh'd</hi> and <hi>Acted;</hi> which (we were perſwaded) were <hi>Erroneous,</hi> and ought to have been Teſtified againſt: And therefore, did propoſe unto them, to joyn with us, to give Teſtimony againſt ſuch Things, (if in their Conſciences they were ſatisfied ſo to do) as one proper Expedient, for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Stumbling-Blocks out of the Way;</hi> as by the ſaid Letter (Dated <hi>Briſtol</hi> the <hi>22th.</hi> of the <hi>2d.</hi> Moneth, <hi>1679.</hi>) may more largely appear, unto any of the ſaid People, who may deſire of me to peruſe the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the aforeſaid Letter, we did adviſe, That the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript</hi> made mention of, was prepared, and that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> thereof were, as is already cited: But foraſmuch as no Anſwer came from the Parties written unto, before the <hi>General-Meeting,</hi> and that the Matter treated on, was not with an Intent, that it ſhould be kept private in the
<pb facs="tcp:57559:10"/>Breaſts of thoſe, to whom 'twas written; but be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the <hi>Body</hi> of the People called <hi>Quakers:</hi> therefore, we ſent the aforeſaid Letter unto the <hi>General-Meeting,</hi> next following, for the ſame End, as we did unto thoſe <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> to whom we firſt writ; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Cover thereto in theſe following Words: Only, 'tis to be noted, that a Blank thus [—] is left inſtead of the Name of a Perſon, for the Reaſons hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

            <p>The aforeſaid Report Occaſions me to make theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Obſervations:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the reſt of the <hi>General Meeters,</hi> who are kept ignorant of any Letter directed to them, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in deceived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Wrong was done to the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in writing to the <hi>General Meeting,</hi> becauſe their Minds were not Communicated unto thoſe, unto whom they writ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Generality of Friends in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might deem it Injurious to them, becauſe the ſaid <hi>Letter</hi> was of a General Tendency, with reſpect to Friends, and Affairs relating to them.</p>
            <p>This Proceeding encreaſed the Jealouſies of many Friends, that a Spirit of Partiality, ſeeking to exerciſe a <hi>Gentilian</hi> ſort of Lordſhip, was entring ſome, under the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Truth, and that the Door was ſo ſhut againſt ſome others, beſides my ſelf, as that thoſe things which become our Burthens, muſt not be repreſented to thoſe, whom we were concerned to adviſe thereof, or to treat withal in a <hi>Chriſtian-Spirit,</hi> that ſo ſome Expedient (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Truth) might be found, to remove our Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and ſo (if poſſible) prevent the Publication in Print, of the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> prepared; in which the Names of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hundreds on each part, concerned in the Diviſion, were mentioned.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57559:13"/>
            <p>But yet, the Noiſe of Printing had this Service, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Friends from divers Parts of the Nation, came to the City of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> being the Place (as before is noted) that one (Eminently concerned in the Diviſion) threatned, ſhould be the <hi>Anvil to beat upon;</hi> and interceded, that we would forbear making mention of the Names of Perſons reflected on. To this the <hi>Anſwer</hi> was; That it ſeemed unlikely, to bring forth a Credible Hiſtory, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religious Differences, without naming the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> of <hi>Books, Papers,</hi> and <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Perſons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on; evidencing the Reality of ſuch Principles, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Practices, which occaſioned <hi>Diſunion</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> amongſt ſome of the aforeſaid People. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Truth obliged us to have a Tender Regard unto thoſe, who came unto us in Brotherly Love; and for the Sakes of ſuch, our Deſires have been, that the Lord might permit us to <hi>Bear, Forbear</hi> and <hi>Suffer;</hi> having a ſecret Hope, that the Lord might make ſuch Inſtruments in his Hand, by a Tender and Brotherly Mediation, to cauſe the <hi>High and Lofty</hi> to bow to Truth and Righteouſneſs, that ſo the Government of <hi>Chriſt</hi> might be exalted in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Heart, where his Law is written; and that none, who make mention of his Name, might conclude themſelves entred into an Heavenly Poſſeſſion or Inheritance, becauſe of a Strict Obſervance of ſome <hi>Outward written Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, preſcribed by Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57559:13"/>
            <p>After we had long born, it then more particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my Concern, to prepare another <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> (and that chiefly out of the <hi>Second Part</hi> of what was firſt prepared, in relation to divers Perſons concerned in the Diviſions) to diſcover that one Man, <hi>George For,</hi> guilty of many Things reproachful to the Truth; and that, becauſe it was, and yet is clearly manifeſted unto me, and (as I have underſtood) many others, that that <hi>ONE PERSON</hi> hath been the very Chief Inſtrument, (or at leaſt, an Abettor of ſuch as have) whereby a <hi>Biting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Spirit,</hi> is entred in amongſt the Flock; and yet great Part of the Contention of one Party with another, ſeems to be but about the <hi>Shell,</hi> and not the <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel:</hi> My Meaning thereby is, about <hi>Outward Forms and Methods, relating to Marriages, Relief of the Poor,</hi> &amp;c. as if Hells Gates muſt be opened to receive all ſuch, as walk not in that <hi>Outward Path,</hi> which (in Relation thereto) hath been preſcribed by that <hi>ONE MAN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, 'Tis obſervable, that before I undertook to prepare the <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> relating to that <hi>ONE MAN.</hi> I writ unto him Seven Letters, (Dated as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>27th.</hi> of the <hi>1ſt.</hi> Moneth, <hi>1677.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> of the <hi>10th.</hi> Moneth, <hi>1677.</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> of the <hi>11th.</hi> Moneth, <hi>1678.</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> of the <hi>11th.</hi> Moneth, <hi>1678.</hi> one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the ſame Day, ſigned by <hi>Thomas Gouldeny, William Forde,</hi> and <hi>My Self;</hi> one other the <hi>22th.</hi> of the <hi>2d.</hi> Moneth, <hi>1679.</hi> ſigned by <hi>My Self,</hi> and <hi>Three other
<pb facs="tcp:57559:14"/>Friends,</hi> directed to Him, and two Others; and one other from <hi>My Self</hi> only, Dated the <hi>6th.</hi> of the <hi>12th.</hi> Moneth, <hi>1679.</hi> manifeſting the <hi>Ground of my Diſſatisfaction,</hi> with relation to many Things of a <hi>Publick Concern amongſt Friends,</hi> as well as <hi>Perſonal Injury;</hi> which became him to clear, or elſe give <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> And yet to this Day (being the <hi>16th.</hi> Day of the <hi>6th.</hi> Moneth, <hi>1680.)</hi> I cannot in Truth ſay, That any <hi>Anſwer</hi> is come from him to me; notwithſtanding Meſſengers were ſent unto him on purpoſe with ſeveral of them, and Advice given me of the Delivery. And though a Paper came once to my Hand, in which Mention is made of Two of the ſaid Letters; yet I cannot take it to be <hi>his Anſwer;</hi> but rather (as by the Language thereof appears) the <hi>Anſwer of another on his behalf,</hi> and chiefly ſtuff'd with <hi>Queries;</hi> ſo that my Concern to <hi>expect Satisfaction,</hi> or <hi>Detect him,</hi> is encreas'd.</p>
            <p>At length, when I perceived 'twas not probable to obtain what I expected from him, by making manifest my Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Exerciſe, either to <hi>Him,</hi> or <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> (whom I ſuppoſed, he might eſteem to be of the <hi>Church</hi>) nor yet from the <hi>General Meeting;</hi> though (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) they are eſteemed by ſome (though not by all) the <hi>Repreſentatives of the Church in general:</hi> I then (for the Sakes of many Brethren) Travelled in ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Nation;</hi> manifeſting, that (according to the Underſtanding given me of <hi>God</hi>) I had proceeded toward
<pb facs="tcp:57559:14"/>that <hi>ONE PERSON, G. F.</hi> in a Goſpel-Method; and that, if I then ſhould have proceeded to Print againſt him, nothing could be juſtly laid to my Charge, for want of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Proceeding to obtain Satisfaction:</hi> which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto was not given me. But yet my Condeſcenſion to my Brethren was ſuch, as that, though the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him was prepared, I very publickly propoſed in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under my Hand, and ſpread the ſame abroad, directed to Friends in ſeveral Counties; ſignifying, that if any one of them were free to write unto that <hi>ONE PERSON,</hi> or at least to give this Teſtimony under their or any of their Hands, that ſince I Charge him to be Guilty of Things reproachful to the Truth, 'Tis but Juſt and Reaſonable, that he ſhould ſubmit to a Hearing thereof, before Friends in Truth; to the end, that if Guilty, he may <hi>Condemn</hi> the ſame; if not, he may be <hi>Juſtifyed,</hi> and I <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> for Accuſing wrongfully: I ſhould then forbear Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt him, until ſuch time I ſhould ſend ſuch a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Teſtimony unto the Place of his Habitation: And if he ſhould be pleaſed to give Anſwer thereto, (on Requeſt to him, to be made by the Meſſenger that ſhould go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with) then my Purpoſe was, (as I then declared) to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſuch Anſwer to Friends; that ſo we might conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der further, what might be agreeable to Truth, to be done on this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>One Part of my End in thus doing, was, <hi>To diſcover whether there be ſuch an Erroneous Principle in any,
<pb facs="tcp:57559:15"/>ſo to ſtand by a Man, charged to be guilty of Things reproachful to the Truth, as that he muſt be exempted (though Guilty) from the Stroke of that Juſtice, which in the like Caſes of Guilt he hath preſcribed for others.</hi> For though the Apostle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed, <hi>That Charity ſuffereth long, beareth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth all things;</hi> yet his Meaning was not, that any Member of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> of what Degree ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhould not be treated withal, when over-taken in a Fault; elſe the ſame Apoſtle would not have given theſe Teſtimonies;
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.5.</note> 
               <hi>Every Man ſhall bear his own Burthen.
<note place="margin">Col. 3.25.</note> He that doth Wrong, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for the Wrong, which he hath done;</hi> and there is <hi>no Reſpect of Perſons.</hi> Beſides, 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable from the Scriptures of Truth,
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.2.</note> that <hi>'Twas Praiſe-worthy, not to bear Lyars, though they might ſay, they were Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to inform the <hi>Reader,</hi> that the enſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> is for the moſt part Collected out of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript,</hi> firſt made mention of: But yet with the Omiſſion of ſome <hi>Marginal Memorials,</hi> directing the <hi>Reader</hi> to the ſeveral Sections of the Second Part of the ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript,;</hi> that ſo from Matter of Fact therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Truth of Reflections made, and the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Objections raiſed, (and that from the Books, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, or Practices of ſome particular Perſon, or Perſons reputed of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<pb facs="tcp:57559:15"/>And therefore, ſince it is not thought fit, for the Reaſons mentioned in this <hi>Preface,</hi> to Publiſh the Second Part of the ſaid <hi>Manuſcript;</hi> we (inſtead thereof) for the Satisfaction of all Friends, do declare, That 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the View of any Friend, in order to prove the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs</hi> of the <hi>Reflections made,</hi> or <hi>Objections raiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus premiſed, I now come again to lay down the Three before-mentioned <hi>Queries,</hi> and to give direct <hi>Anſwers</hi> thereto.</p>
            <p>Quer. <hi>1. Why haſt thou omitted to mention the <hi>Names of ſome Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Authors of ſome Books</hi> and <hi>Papers</hi> reflected on in this Treatiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though I have been reflected upon at an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Rate by many, becauſe I have been concerned to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an <hi>Erroneous,</hi> and <hi>Perſecuting Spirit,</hi> which I have beheld entring amongſt the Flock of <hi>God;</hi> yet, Bleſſed be the <hi>Lord,</hi> he hath ſo preſerved me by the Arm of his Power, as that none of my Oppoſers have (ſo far as I know) laid any thing unto my Charge, but for Matters wherein I have acted, (though miſrepreſented by them) to keep a Conſcience voyd of Offence towards <hi>God.</hi> And as it became my <hi>Concern of Conſcience,</hi> to prepare the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> firſt mentioned, that ſo the Truth of ſome Material Matters (occaſioning, or accompanying
<pb facs="tcp:57559:16"/>Diviſion and Separation amongſt the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>) might lye on Record, at least <hi>Vntil an V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion might again be witneſſed:</hi> So alſo it hath been my frequent Breathing unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> That <hi>I might not bring forth an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntimely Birth;</hi> but might ſo be led, and guided in this Affair, as that I might <hi>Anſwer the Witneſs of <hi>God</hi> in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</hi> And to my inward Peace and Joy in the <hi>Lord,</hi> I can ſay, <hi>That I have the Evidence of his Spirit,</hi> (notwithſtanding, what any Man may ſay to the contrary) <hi>that he hath owned my Proceeding therein hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:</hi> And not only ſo, but that there hath been an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereto in many Brethren.</hi> And as I was ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly waiting on the <hi>Lord,</hi> I became ſatisfied in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to forbear, reflectingly to mention in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> the Names of many reputed <hi>Quakers,</hi> that (as yet I doubt) remain deviated in ſome things from the <hi>Line of Truth;</hi> And I hoped ſuch a Spirit of Mediation and Juſtice, would have appeared amongſt ſome of our <hi>Friends,</hi> (who would not be underſtood to be concerned in the Difference between others) as that they might have been a Means to cauſe <hi>G. F.</hi> to ſtoop ſo timely to Juſtice, as that there might have been no Concern upon me and others to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Part of his Errors, ſo publickly as now they are.</p>
            <p>The Conſiderations occurring in my Breaſt, when I became ſo ſatisfied, as aforeſaid, were theſe:</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57559:16"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Several of my Brethren (as before is premiſed) interceded to forbear; and if for my thus doing, any ſhould reflect upon me, they might as well reflect upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Counſel, when he exhorted the <hi>Epheſians, To ſubmit themſelves one unto another, in the Fear of God.</hi> For I was ſenſible, that thoſe who ſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, had a true Senſe, that the Cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was concerned, was the Cauſe of Truth: On which Foot, their Treatment of me was in much Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and foraſmuch as I perceived, they were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, that a little longer Forbearance might work for the better, I became ſatisfied, 'twas my Place to ſubmit, and forbear a while.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though Hardneſs of Heart hath ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken ſome, as that they may ſtill continue to oppoſe their Brethren in the Truth, without the leaſt juſt Ground, or Pretence either from the Light of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth, or Right Reaſon; yet I am not without hope, that ſome others (concerned againſt their Brethren, in the preſent Differences) may in ſome time come to a Senſe of their Failings, and Repent: and then either the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their Offence may be blotted out,</hi> or their <hi>Repentance therewith</hi> (if timely known) <hi>recorded,</hi> and that according as Opportunity may permit, and Truth require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis hoped, that this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> may become a <hi>Warning</hi> to many; but more eſpecially, to ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:57559:17"/>have departed from the <hi>Anointing</hi> in themſelves, that they may Repent, and turn to their First Love; viz. <hi>The Appearance of Chriſt by his Light in them;</hi> and not (in neglect of <hi>God's</hi> Teachings) lye doting on Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Orders; <hi>As if that which was promiſed to be written in the Heart, were now to be ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Pieces, and Scraps of Paper;</hi> or that the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Orders</hi> of any at this Day, ſhould become a <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule,</hi> through which a Heavenly Poſſeſſion may be obtained by ſuch, as could not own the <hi>Scriptures</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (though by the Spirit given forth) to be that <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule;</hi> but inſtead thereof, the <hi>Spirit</hi> it ſelf to be it. And if any think themſelves hereby reflected on unjuſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at ſome Times they have appeared of another Language; yet, if ſuch by their Fruits have given the Lye to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of their Lips, the Deceit is the greater, and more worthy to be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is chiefly intended for the Service of the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> amongſt whom the Religious Differences are ſo publickly known, as that I have no Cauſe to doubt, but that the Matters treated on, will be intelligible by them, though the Names of ſome Perſons, and Authors of ſome Books and Papers, be not mentioned. However, if any amongſt them, for want of that Publick Converſe, which others have had, ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the leaſt Jealouſie, that there is no Reaſon ſo to Object or Reflect, as in the enſuing <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:57559:17"/>then be ready to give unto ſuch, particular Satisfaction from Matter of Fact, relating to Perſon or Perſons. And foraſmuch, as it was not poſſible, that all Papers and Books, which may evidence the Reaſonableneſs of all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and Reflections, could lye at once in many Hands, and are for the moſt part with me; therefore, this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> is Signed thus: <hi>By <hi>William Rogers,</hi> on Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of himſelf, and other Friends in Truth concerned.</hi> And ſo the Names of thoſe others (my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren concerned with me in this Work) are omitted; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they might not be capable to give a ready and ſatisfactory Anſwer, for want of the Books, or Papers ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified of, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Quer. <hi>2. Why haſt thou treated on <hi>Principles,</hi> held forth by the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſince many Books have already been given forth by ſome amongſt them, treating on many (if not all) of thoſe Things, which thou haſt done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis the Duty of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to clear their Conſciences, as by the Light of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are directed, which doubtleſs was the Real Ground, whereupon many Antient and Honourable Friends (already fallen aſleep) have given forth their Teſtimony, touching the ſame Principles, publickly held forth (both by Word and Printing) by ſome other Servants of the <hi>Lord</hi> before them: And if no more were ſaid to this <hi>Query,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57559:18"/>it ought to ſuffice. But yet, for the Sakes of ſome, I ſhall lay down the Conſiderations attending me, when I became Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly concerned ſo to do.</p>
            <p>The Deportment of ſome <hi>Vnruly Women,</hi> and <hi>Ignorant Self-conceited Men,</hi> on the Part of our Oppoſers, in publick Meetings for Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> have frequently been Cauſe of Stumbling to ſome; ſo that, 'tis to be doubted, that Jealouſies have been ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many, that though the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> yet that the Nature, Life, and Doctrine thereof hath ſuffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack amongſt them, if all (under that Name) ought at this Day to be meaſured by the Deportment, and Doctrine of ſome. The particular Inſtances of ſuch Deportments and Doctrines, (whereof I have been Eye and Ear-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) might fill a large Volumn: And therefore, if this be granted, it cannot but by every Conſiderate and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader, be thought needful enough, that a Teſtimony unto the Principles of Truth (antiently held forth amongſt them) might once more be Revived, and Committed to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, on behalf of that Party amongſt them, who account themſelves Perſecuted, Reviled, and evilly Intreated, when they know no other Cauſe thereof, than in their ſtedfaſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to (and Perſevering in) the Way of the Spirit of Life, in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and having begun in the Spirit, cannot be in Unity with ſuch, as to them ſeem to expect Perfection, through a zealous Exalting of other Mens Lines
<pb facs="tcp:57559:18"/>made ready to their Hands. And thus the Generations to come (as well as at this Day) may know, that though <hi>ſome Lovers of Preheminence, Innovators, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Preachers,</hi> (that know not how to divide the Word aright) have been pleaſed to ſtigmatize others with theſe Terms, viz. <hi>Dark, Leavened, Rending, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Separate Spirits;</hi> yet it hath been manifeſt, that 'tis becauſe ſuch others cannot, in a Temporizing Spirit, change their Way, and depart from their Antient Path; which by the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> they have been led into, and wherein they have had Fellowſhip with their <hi>Antient Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord</hi> Anointed to publiſh his Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Goſpel, and to gather others from the Lo here's, and the Lo there's, to take heed unto the Holy Unction in themſelves, as a Sufficient Guide unto the Father of Life.</p>
            <p>Quer. <hi>3. Whether thy Publiſhing this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> in Print, may not (in probability) give unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a Knowledge of the Differences amongſt us; and ſo obſtruct the Encreaſe of our Meetings, and the gathering of ſome (yet walking in the Broad Way) into the True Faith, and cauſe many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gathered thereunto, to ſtumble and fall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay. The Conſiderations inducing me ſo to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, are theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>

            <p>Though this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> declares, that there are Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> yet that's no more, than what to my Knowledge is publickly known, both to Profeſſor and Prophane: and that from Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch, (in the Publick Meetings for Worſhip, for many Moneths, if not Years paſt) as are not reputed to be of the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi> The Occaſion of ſuch Obſervations in ſome Meetings, hath been ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, as that it ſeems to me to be as impoſſible, to cover the Knowledge thereof, as that which hath been Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by a common <hi>Bell-Man;</hi> and the Inſtruments, which for the most part have been the Proclaimers hereof, have been ſuch, as (under the Notion of Preachers in <hi>God's</hi> Name, though in a Reality, but idle, ignorant Praters in the Will of Man) by their Declarations, run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Friends of Truth, ſometimes by Name, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times not ſo particular, though intelligible enough; and yet incapable to detect ſuch as is Evil, either in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> or <hi>Doctrine:</hi> Which being conſidered, (and compared with many <hi>Imaginary Diſcourſes,</hi> in Publick Meetings for Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> whereby the Publiſhers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appear <hi>Unlearned in the School of Chriſt)</hi> 'tis irrational to expect, that any Perſon, Conſcientiouſly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the <hi>Way of Truth,</hi> ſhould be gathered to ſuch, as are at <hi>Variance</hi> each with other, and whoſe <hi>Publick Aſſemblies</hi> have been at ſome times the very <hi>Stages of Contention;</hi> and if they ſhould, 'tis moſt certain, they
<pb facs="tcp:57559:19"/>would not therein be gathered unto ſuch, as are in an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Fellowſhip</hi> each with other: but if on the contrary, ſuch as are ſeeking after the <hi>way of Truth,</hi> amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have been diſaffected with them in general, from a certain Knowledge of their diviſions, and the unſound Doctrines held forth by ſome; and yet ſhall but ſeriouſly ponder this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> it may become a means unto ſuch to eſchew the <hi>Evil,</hi> and embrace the <hi>Good,</hi> by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their hearts unto the Principles of Truth herein held forth, and not ſuffering the offence (given by ſuch amongſt them, as have retained the <hi>Name</hi> but not the <hi>Nature</hi> (nor yet in ſome reſpects the <hi>Doctrine</hi>) of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>) ſo to enter, as to hinder their Perſeverance and Growth in the true Faith, untill at length they may come into Union, and Fellowſhip with the faithful Friends thereof.</p>
            <p>Moreover to me it ſeems impoſſible, that the ſeaſonable aſſerting the <hi>Truth,</hi> and pleading for it, can occaſion any to ſtumble and fall from it; but rather the Contrary. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I muſt confeſs, 'tis probable enough, that it may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion many to diſregard ſuch kind of <hi>Preachers</hi> (or rather <hi>Praters</hi>) whoſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> have not only cauſed the <hi>Name of the Lord to be evil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of,</hi> but whoſe <hi>Neceſſities</hi> have ſeemed to be a <hi>Bait</hi> unto them, to <hi>Follow for the Loaves;</hi> and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if theſe, inſtead of <hi>Gathering to God, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to themſelves;</hi> and as a proper expedient to obtain ſuch a gathering, publiſh in the open Meetings for
<pb facs="tcp:57559:20"/>Worſhip of God, ſuch like Doctrines as theſe, (according as I have already hinted) and which, I am a witneſs, (from the hearing of my ear) have in publick meetings for worſhip been publiſht, <hi>viz. <hi>Have your Eye to the Brethren</hi>
               </hi> (meaning thereby <hi>Publick Preachers</hi>) <hi>If you do not ſee your ſelves, follow us that do ſee.</hi> And frequently exhort to <hi>ſhut out the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, the Wiſdom and the Iealouſy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction:</hi> which being compared with theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and wholeſome Exhortations, and Doctrines <hi>[Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is Iuſtified of her Children; look not unto us, but unto the Lord; take heed unto the Light of Chriſt in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; Draw water out of your own Wells, let it be your own and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers]</hi> it ſeems to me more like the Language of thoſe Shepherds, who (as the Prophet ſaid) <hi>Sought for their gain from their Quarters,</hi> than the Language of ſuch whom the Lord hath anointed to cheriſh and feed his Sheep.</p>
            <p>To Conclude this Preface, 'tis with me to ſay, unto every one (through the Nations) called by the name <hi>Quaker,</hi> on this wiſe.</p>
            <p>Let the remembrance of the dayes that are paſt come before you, wherein the <hi>Servants</hi> of the <hi>Living God, Labourers</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57559:20"/>in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (in the beginning of the latter Day of the Miniſtration of <hi>Light</hi>) ſounded by his trumpet an Alarm to the Nations. <hi>And what ſaid the voice of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power through them?</hi> It ſpoke to this effect unto the inhabitants of the Earth. <hi>Awake, Awake from the ſleep of Death, that the Lord may give unto you Life. He that was, and is, and is to come, is ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in a remnant; and Chriſt, the Son of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God</hi> (who was with the Father before the Foundation of the World was laid) <hi>is become the Horn of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and hath brought Immortality to Light in them, and revealed that Teacher, that can never be moved into a corner; and therefore theſe cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend any longer on the teachings of man, nor yet on outward Canonical Articles, Creeds, Directories, or Church-Faiths preſcribed by man: but on the teachings of Chriſt alone, by his Light and Spiritual appearance in themſelves, to lead and guide unto the Father of life.</hi> The ſound of this Alarm (as many can yet witneſs) became a joyful ſound to that ſoul, which was hungring after the Lord; though piercing as a Dart through the liver to the man of ſin, ſo that <hi>aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>amazement</hi> ſeemed to take hold on many, whereby they became a <hi>By-word,</hi> a <hi>Mock,</hi> and a <hi>Taunt</hi> unto ſuch, whoſe dependencies were on their <hi>outward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp;c.</hi> as aforeſaid. I ſay again, Oh Friends, let the Remembrance of this Day come before you, and conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:57559:21"/>
               <hi>what was the voice of the Eternal Power</hi> unto ſuch, who were ſtruck with amazement, after they believed the appearance of that power, whereby they were ſo ſtruck, to be the appearance of the Power of God; I well remember the voice was on this wiſe, <hi>To your own, To your own, To your own.</hi> Meaning thereby that they ſhould turn in their minds to the Light of Chriſt in their conſciences, which was declared to be that teacher, which could never be removed into a corner, that ſo they might witneſs the fulfilling of that loud voice, uttered by the <hi>Angel</hi> flying through the midſt of Heaven, Having the everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth, <hi>&amp;c. Fear God and give glory to him, for the Hour of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is come, and worſhip him that made Heaven and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. For no doubt but the Spirit of the Lord, revealed unto thoſe <hi>firſt labourers in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> that there was a proneneſſe in the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men, to admire, to depend upon, and ſometimes (through an affectionate part or blind Zeal) to worſhip ſuch are were inſtruments, to give forth outward Directories, or Church-Faiths. For we find that the Apoſtle tells us <hi>of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Angels</hi> (which are Meſſengers whom God hath ſent) <hi>by him that intrudes into things which he hath not ſeen;</hi> therefore I am perſwaded that the voice of Truth through them was not only thus, viz. <hi>To your own</hi> (which being obſerved, leads into an independency upon others) but alſo frequently on this wiſe, <hi>We preach not our ſelves, look not unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57559:21"/>
            <p>In the Conſideration of theſe things I cannot but cry aloud, in the aforeſaid words of the Angel, that had the everlaſting Goſpel to Preach, <hi>Fear God, and give Glory to him.</hi> And then no doubt but every ſuch one, that hath concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf to condemn his Brother, on no better ground than from the example and preſcription of another, will come to ſee, that therein he hath not kept to his own, and ſo hath been led into a By and Erring Path. Oh Friends! let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this cry paſs through every heart. <hi>To our Own. To our Own. To our Own.</hi> (That is to ſay, to every ones own meaſure of Chriſt's Light or Grace of God Received, which the Apoſtle ſaith is ſufficient) with this ſecret breathing of Spirit unto the God of our lives, that all may be thereto retired. For if that Counſel might but take place, it ſeems to me, that there could then be no room for any to impoſe, or preſs the obſervation of other mens Lines upon any (which no doubt is one great occaſion of the religious differences treated on) and not only ſo, but it would mould all, (who retain the name of Chriſtianity) into the very nature thereof, and ſo conſequently, a reconciliation in the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Truth might quickly enſue: For if that Door be but once ſhut, through which variance and diſunion entred, there may then ariſe a hope of ceſſation to ſuch contention and ſtrife, as is out of the Truth: but if not, I may then ſay, how can the effect ceaſe, whilſt the cauſe remains?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57559:22"/>
            <p>I well Remember, and many with me, that whil'ſt friends kept to their <hi>Own,</hi> and concerned not themſelves to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a zealous obſervation of other mens Lines made ready to their hands, we then heard not of ſo much contention, ſtrife and debate, both publick and private, as of late years hath been: but ſince the promotion thereof, Confuſion, Diſorder, Emulation, Malice and Envy hath been its Offspring which hath been manifeſted by publick unjuſt revilings againſt ſome, when zealouſly contending for the Faith of Gods Elect; and though theſe are of that number that prefer obedience to their own meaſures of Grace received, before obedience to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of others; yet other ſome there are, who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring Friends into conformity to the pretended Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the Spirit through others; or at beſt through that one man <hi>G. F.</hi> before ſpoken of: and that under the penalty of being accounted guilty of <hi>Corah's</hi> ſin, for ſcrupling to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and thus the variance is like to continue, unleſs the God of Heaven for his Names ſake, by the Arm of his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhall put a ſtop thereto.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as I could not but ſay, in all ſeriouſneſs of Spirit, for the clearing of my conſcience; Let the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the dayes that are paſt come before you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Servants of the living God ſounded by his trumpet an Alarm to the Nations, and that the Servant of the Lord <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> (many years deceaſed) is honourably ſpoken of by ſome, if not by all of both parties, of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> at variance, one that had the Trumpet
<pb facs="tcp:57559:22"/>of the Lord to ſound, and hath therewith ſounded (as a Son of thunder, as well as of conſolation) many Alarm unto the Nations. I ſhall conclude with the citation of a part of an Epiſtle written by him, in the Year, <hi>1658.</hi> to the Friends of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and ſo leave the conſideration thereof to the Impartial Reader, to ſavour whether according to the ſenſe of his counſel, we ought not to know the Spirit of God in our ſelves, to be the ground of all our actions; and if ſo, then to practiſe from other mens Lines, without an inward conviction by the Spirit in our ſelves, can be no more accepted (as indeed it is not) than the offering of the halt and the blind for a Sacrifice, under the firſt Covenant was.</p>

            <p>To the Matter in hand on this Occaſion, I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Vatter</hi> (as I underſtand) diſliked, is <hi>my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to print againſt</hi> George Fox.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Reaſons</hi> pretended to be given behind my back, without ſo much as <hi>Firſt</hi> ſignifying any thing by <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Writing</hi> to me (ſo far as I know) againſt my ſo doing, are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That though I pretended, I had often ſent to <hi>George Fox</hi> about giving me a Meeting, and that I alſo came up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to read a <hi>Charge</hi> againſt him, behind his back, at which time (as 'tis ſaid) I was then told by ſome, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>
                  <hi>Grorge Fox</hi> would be at the General Meeting;</hi> yet when he did come to it (although I had advice from <hi>James Claypoole</hi> of his being come) I neither took any notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, nor yet ſent to him: and yet further alſo (as I now am informed) ſome do raiſe as a great Argument (in their Eſteem) againſt me this alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> That when I was laſt in the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſince the <hi>General</hi> Meeting, I was alſo informed by the ſaid <hi>James Claypoole,</hi> that <hi>George Fox</hi> was but a few Miles off, and yet did neither go to him, nor ſtay until he came to the City; but inſtead thereof, haſted out of Town, with great Diligence; which (as ſome ſay) ſhewed, that whatever I had pretended to meet <hi>George Fox,</hi> yet I had no deſire thereto.</p>
            <p>My Concern now is for the Sakes of ſuch ſimple ones, who may be apt to take <hi>Shadows</hi> for <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent irrational</hi> (as well as <hi>irreligious</hi> and <hi>unchriſtian-like</hi>) <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes</hi> for <hi>Oracles,</hi> when dropping either from the Mouth or Pen of <hi>one,</hi> unto whom (according to their Principle) they may think themſelves oblieged to have an Eye, to diſcover the <hi>Impertinency</hi> and <hi>Fallaciouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Reaſons</hi> urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my proceeding to print againſt <hi>George Fox.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57559:24"/>
            <p>In order thereto, I firſt obſerve, that from the aforeſaid pretended <hi>Reaſons,</hi> this pretended <hi>Argument</hi> may be urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iames Claypoole,</hi> being at <hi>London,</hi> informs <hi>William Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> then at <hi>Lriſtol,</hi> that <hi>George Fox</hi> was come to the City, and afterwards informs <hi>William Rogers,</hi> when at <hi>London,</hi> that <hi>George Fox</hi> was but a few Miles from the City; but <hi>William Rogers</hi> takes no notice thereof, nor yet ſent to him, nor waited for <hi>George Fox's</hi> coming to the City; therefore <hi>William Rogers</hi> had no deſire to meet <hi>G. F.</hi> when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo pretended.</p>
            <p>Were this to come only to the View of Men of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and impartial, I might well ſtop my Pen from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt to diſcover the weakneſs and fallacy of ſuch idle ſort of Diſcourſes; becauſe ſuch would firſt be apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>For what End I deſired a Meeting with</hi> G. F? and when they ſhould be Informed, <hi>That 'twas to prove him guilty of things reproachfull to the Truth and that he would by no means aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch a Meeting;</hi> they would be ready to conclude, that 'twas his beſt defence to cover his Guilt from the Knowledge of ſuch, whoſe Faith might be in him; and ſo conclude, that no Obligation in Truth might be upon me to take any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notice of him as to a Meeting (had it ſo happened, as that I had accidently meet him in the very Street; much leſs ride 94 Miles upon bare report from the ſaid <hi>J. C.</hi> that he was in <hi>London;</hi> as if my Buſineſs were the Buſineſs of ſuch a poor Penſioner, that had nothing to do, but to attend G. <hi>F's</hi> Motion) but rather to endeavour to clear my Conſcience otherwiſe, as now I am about to do. However, for the Sakes of others, I ſhall proceed to clear the matter objected ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, I muſt tell thoſe evil Inſinuators, who ſay, <hi>That I had no deſire to meet</hi> G. F. <hi>when I writ to him of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs ſo to do,</hi> that therein they belye me.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57559:25"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Argument pretended to be deducible from the aforeſaid Reaſons, cannot be good, unleſs this following Aſſertion ought to be owned by every one, that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to meet with <hi>George Fox,</hi> on the like occaſion as I had, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, That on the ſaid <hi>J. C's</hi> notice, that <hi>George Fox</hi> is, or will be at <hi>London,</hi> then 'tis the Duty of any Friend, that hath a deſire to meet <hi>G. F.</hi> to come ninety four Miles to <hi>London</hi> out of all the throng of his other Occaſions; or if in <hi>London,</hi> to wait for <hi>George Fox's</hi> coming thither, when near it, to ask him by <hi>Word of Mouth,</hi> that which hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore asked by <hi>Writing,</hi> and no Anſwer given, ſignifying the leaſt aſſent to meet, as hereafter will appear. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will be a very ready way to bring <hi>Outward Blaſting,</hi> according to the Propheſies of ſome of my Oppoſers, if they could but create a Belief in me, that on <hi>I. C's</hi> notice, that <hi>G. F.</hi> will be in <hi>London,</hi> I muſt then run after him, and attend upon him, on no other Foot, but to know whether he will meet me, without any aſſurance that he would be willing, notwithſtanding I have laboured and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo long before to obtain it, and all in vain.</p>
            <p>On this Occaſion, two things are worthy of ſome Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Whether</hi> George Fox <hi>is really ſo dignifyed, as that 'tis an Additional Errour in one whom he accounts a loſt Sheep, not to run after and wait on him.</hi> If he were in reality the great Apoſtle of Chriſt (as eſteemed by ſome) methinks he ſhould have in his Remembrance, the Parable ſpoken of by Chriſt, touching leaving the <hi>Ninety nine Sheep</hi> to ſeek the <hi>One</hi> that was loſt; and ſo account it his Duty to ſeek after (much more be ready to meet) <hi>one</hi> accounted a <hi>Loſt Sheep,</hi> that hath been ſo deſirous to meet him, as I have been?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Whether</hi> James Claypoole <hi>be in reality ſo dignifyed, as that on his Notice 'tis the duty of a friend, having a concern upon him relating to</hi> George Fox, <hi>to ride ninety four miles or wait, out of all his urging occaſions many days to attend on</hi> G. F.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57559:25"/>
               <hi>When not willing to Anſwer the end to be waited for, or elſe muſt incar ſuch like Cenſures as are pat upon me for ſuch an Omiſſion?</hi> I cannot but conclude, that the Lord hath not ſo dignifyed either of them; and that the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of this <hi>Enquiry</hi> is the <hi>Fruit of Pride,</hi> or a <hi>Gentilian</hi> ſort of <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> which the God of Heaven is determined to abaſe.</p>
            <p>As to the report, <hi>That I came up to the City of</hi> London, <hi>to read a Charge behind</hi> George Fox's <hi>Back,</hi> I thus Anſwer; as 'tis above repreſented, the Action ſeems vile and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-like, becauſe from that Repreſentation, it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if I would in a Secret way endeavour to back-bite and reproach <hi>George Fox,</hi> and avoid all Occaſions of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him Face to Face, which I abhor: and as on the one hand I ſo do, ſo on the other hand, I account it vile and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-like, to ſpread ſuch a Repreſentation of the matter, and not declare the whole Truth, and End for which my coming then was, which if it had, I might not then have had Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have added this <hi>Poſtſcript;</hi> but ſince it is ſo, I think it needful to inform the Reader of the very naked Truth, from whence I take that evil Inſinuation or partial Report to ariſe.</p>
            <p>After I had by ſeveral Letters, ſignifyed to <hi>G. F.</hi> divers Things, touching which I expected Satisfaction from him, and had ſufficient ground to believe, that he would not give it; and having a Jealouſie that many under the Name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> looked upon him as <hi>Infallible;</hi> I was conſtrained in my Spirit to prepare a <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> to diſcover his Errours, out ſtill with this reſerve, that if Friends would ſo aſſiſt, as that I might have Juſtice among them, in relation to him, I might forbear. Amongſt other Places I came to <hi>London,</hi> and ſpread the matter before <hi>James Claypoole,</hi> and three other antient Friends, reputed of the chiefeſt, from whom I could have no hopes, that a Meeting would be aſſented to on the Occaſion deſired, to clear my ſelf; and therefore a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of <hi>Conſcience</hi> was upon me, to write the enſuing Letter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57559:26"/>to <hi>James Claypoole</hi> and thoſe other three Friends, to give co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto the enſuing Remonſtrance to the Friends of <hi>London,</hi> from both which the purpoſe of my Mind may be collected, and whether or no I did not therein Act Chriſtian-like, and do as much as in me did lie with a clear Conſcience, that <hi>G. F's</hi> Nakedneſs might not be ſo publickly diſcovered, as now it is.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>FRiends,</hi> you may remember, that when I parted with you Yeſterday, you were deſirous to know, <hi>where I would be in the Evening,</hi> I told you to this purpoſe, <hi>I knew not certainly,</hi> but yet alſo acquainted you to this purpoſe, <hi>That if you would appoint me to meet you,</hi> I ſhould readily aſſent thereto: and though you did not appoint me, yet I was in Expectation that you, or at leſt ſome of you, might have had a Deſire to ſpeak with me again: but underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing thereof, I am clear in my Spirit to depart the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to let you have the Encloſed with an earneſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto the Lord, that he may direct you to make that uſe thereof, as may tend to his Honour. And that I may not be wanting to open unto you that Counſel, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is the Counſel of the Lord in this Caſe, I thus ſay, that my Perſwaſion is, 'twill tend moſt to the Honour of God, not to keep the encloſed from the Knowledge of the Friends
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57559:26"/>of the City, and if you are not free to appoint a <hi>Meeting</hi> for the reading thereof, then to <hi>conſider</hi> of ſome <hi>other Way,</hi> to <hi>communicate</hi> the ſame unto the <hi>Flock of God</hi> in this City. For you know not, but that a <hi>Word from the Lord</hi> may ariſe <hi>out of the Breaſt of a Babe</hi> or <hi>Suckling,</hi> that may in this Caſe be piercing as a Dart, to cauſe the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Lofty</hi> to bow to Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, and no longer give <hi>Occaſions of Jealouſy,</hi> that any one <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who profeſs the Truth,</hi> ſhould ſtand as an <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Juſtifyed Perſon,</hi> when ſuch an One (being charged with things <hi>reproachful to the Truth</hi>) endeavours to evade the <hi>ſtroke</hi> of that <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which in like Caſes he hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for others.</p>
                     <p>Oh Friends! In the preſence of the <hi>Lord,</hi> I affirm, the Sins of <hi>G. Fox</hi> to have been <hi>notorious.</hi> God in his Mercy hath manifeſted him to be a Fallible Man, and according to a <hi>Goſpel Method</hi> his Errours have been laid before him, and he will not hear; and now my <hi>Concern of Conſcience is,</hi> to cry <hi>aloud for juſtice,</hi> and to ſignifie, <hi>that I am conſtrained to detect him for his Evil, and Errours by a printed Record,</hi> unleſs ſome Expedient may be found agreeable to Truth, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my Conſcience otherwiſe. And if you and others, appear not to take Notice of the <hi>Call,</hi> and <hi>Cry,</hi> ſo as in Truth you, and they ought, then (ſince he will not hear the word of Truth from my Pen) let both you and all ſuch unto whom this <hi>Cry,</hi> and <hi>Call</hi> may, or ſhall come, ſtop your Mouthes from <hi>gainſaying</hi> my proceeding, to clear my Conſcience, in the method that may ſeem to me moſt expedient, leſt you be found fighters againſt that which the Lord by a Conſtrant of his Power leads into. And Builders again of the things that you have deſtroyed. For as the Principle of Truth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver led us to reſpect Perſons in Judgement: ſo hath it not led us to refuſe to call upon the <hi>Higheſt,</hi> as well as the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> to ſtoop to a juſt hearing, when Matters of <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Evil Fact</hi> ſhall be laid at the Door of ſuch an one.</p>

                     <p>That I may as much as in me lies, be eaſed in my Spirit, with Relation to you, I cannot but in <hi>Bowels</hi> of true Love warn you, that theſe my few Lines may be read in the Fear and Dread of the Living God, that ſo if it may be with you to Anſwer, or Act any thing in Relation hereunto, you may not Add to my <hi>Burthens,</hi> by grieving that which the Lord never grieved.

                     <head>A Poſtſcript.</head>
                     <p>That which hath dropt from one, or ſome of your Lips ſince my coming to <hi>London,</hi> hath occaſioned me to add this <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MY End in communicating unto you, what is with me on this Occaſion, is not that either you, or any ſhould take upon you to Judge the Cauſe, without aſſent or hearing both of <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>my ſelf:</hi> and if any hath, or ſhall endeavour to inſinuate the contrary, from any thing which I have either Spoken, or Written, the God of Heaven will blaſt that Spirit from whence it hath or may come, as that which ſeeks Occaſion againſt me undeſervedly. The like Practice is that <hi>Crying Sin,</hi> which my Conſcience hath been concerned to cry againſt, knowing that it hath entered many under the Profeſſion of Truth, and for which their Names lye on Record to their Shame; but yet, I am not without this ſecret hope, that the Day will come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many of them may repent of the ſame: I cannot alſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57559:27"/>but inform you, that it is the Fruit of <hi>Groſs Darkneſs,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſuch as are at Unity with <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> on a Religious Score (and that on the Foot of ſuch Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to <hi>John Parrot</hi> and his Followers in the Practice of <hi>keeping on their hats in Prayer;</hi> becauſe <hi>John Perrot's</hi> Practice therein, might properly be termed ſuch <hi>Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> as tended to <hi>Schiſm,</hi> contrary to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Practice of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and ſo was worthily Judged, and Condemned: but as to <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> I remember not, that ever any accuſed them, for <hi>introducing any Practice into the Church of God, contrary to the Scriptures of Truth, Light of Chriſt Jeſus, or the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Practice of Friends, when at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the Truth:</hi> and not only ſo, but I am well ſatisfyed in my Conſcience (and that on ſufficient ground, too large here to inſert) that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecret reaſon wherefore <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> have been Judged by many, though unheard by ſuch to ſpeak for themſelves, and that Certificates againſt them have been either ſent, or approved to be ſent abroad by <hi>George Fox,</hi> with direction to ſend them both to Enemies and Friends, is, becauſe they cannot ſtoop and bow to <hi>Innovation,</hi> not practiſed by Friends when in Unity in the Truth; nor yet juſtifyable from the Scriptures of Truth, or the Light of Chriſt in their Conſciences. And if any, to whom theſe Lines may come, have, or may think me too Zealous, I earneſtly deſire, that ſuch may Watch againſt a <hi>Luke-warm Spirit,</hi> and that which is inclinable to <hi>Reſpect Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Judgement;</hi> and not only ſo, but againſt that Spirit that hath been ready to proclaim the ſuppoſed Infirmities of ſome on the Houſe-top, whileſt Endeavours are made to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sins of the High and Lofty one, <hi>George Fox,</hi> though the ſo doing, hath tended to the ſtumbling of many amongſt the <hi>Flock of God,</hi> whoever may ſo do, and for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57559:28"/>thereof ſhall pervert the Counſel, and Intent of the Apoſtle, when he exhorted to bear all things, as if that Scripture might be produced to cover the <hi>Notorious Sins of One,</hi> that may pretend himſelf <hi>Infallible,</hi> I then ſay, <hi>It is the ready way to introduce a Juſtification of</hi> Rantiſm <hi>it ſelf.</hi>

                     <p>I now am further to acquaint you, that if either of you, or any Friend unto whom this may come, being written for publick View amongſt Friends, ſhall within twenty dayes time after the date hereof, write unto <hi>George Fox,</hi> and therein ſignify to this Purpoſe, <hi>That ſince I call for Juſtice and Satisfaction for Wrongs done, and Things acted by him reproachful to the Truth, he then ought to ſubmit to a Hearing thereof before Friends in Truth, that ſo if guilty, he may Condemn it, and if not, he may be Juſtifed;</hi> I then ſhall freely forbear printing againſt him, until ſuch time he either ſendeth Anſwer to ſuch a Letter, or elſe ſendeth no Anſwer, when it may be deſired of him; but yet with this proviſo, that ſuch, ſo to be concerned, ſend the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me, to be ſent unto him, and if he ſhall Anſwer, and propoſe ſuch a Method for a Hearing, as may be approved in my Conſcience, I may then ſubmit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

Which I did underſtand (or at leaſt ſuppoſe) was urged as an Argument, <hi>that I ought thereupon to forbear Printing,</hi> which occaſioned me immediately on receipt thereof to take care, that my Mind might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto <hi>Nicholas Lucas</hi> of <hi>Hartford,</hi> who thereupon, as I am adviſed, acquainted <hi>William Mead,</hi> that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (meaning that I would give <hi>George Fox</hi> a Meeting) was accepted by me, provided that <hi>George Fox</hi> would give it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand (meaning thereby to meet me) to which <hi>William Mead</hi> ſaid, he would ſpeak to <hi>George Fox</hi> about it; and afterwards the ſaid <hi>William Mead</hi> told <hi>Nicholas Lucas</hi> he had ſpoke with <hi>G.

                  <p>FOraſmuch as it hath of late been frequently diſcourſed, amongſt ſome of the People called <hi>Quakers, That I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Print againſt Friends:</hi> and not only ſo, but ſuch my reputed Intentions have been made uſe of as a Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to render me <hi>Wicked,</hi> and thereby to diſaffect Simple-hearted well meaning Friends, towards my ſelf and other Friends in Truth: 'tis now become my further Concern to add theſe few Lines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such Inſinuators cannot be therein guilty of leſs than <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>Slander,</hi> becauſe <hi>it was not then known what would be printed by me.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> They have had no ground to conjecture, that my <hi>Intentions</hi> were to treat on any thing more, than the Wayes and Means by which the ſaid People (once at Unity) came to be divided; together with ſome part of the Fruits of that <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrines and Practices</hi> we ſtand for, which if brought to Light, ſo as that nothing but the <hi>Naked Truth</hi> might be publiſh't (which ought to have been ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, until the contrary ſhould have appeared) the Queſtion then needful to be anſwered is this, <hi>Whether 'tis matter of evil Fact in me, to publiſh in Print an Hiſtorical Relation of the Truth, as aforeſaid; and that for the clearing of my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the Sin of Diſobedience may not lye at my Door?</hi> The Anſwer in ſhort is, <hi>Nay.</hi> To every <hi>impartial</hi> and unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Reader,</hi> I doubt not, but that the Preface to the <hi>Reader,</hi> the <hi>Introduction</hi> to the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Fourth Parts</hi> of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> may give ſufficient Satisfaction: but leſt the Ignorance and Blindneſs of any ſhould be ſo great, as not from thence to perceive the Righteouſneſs of my preſent proceeding to Print, or that the <hi>Partiality</hi> of any that do ſo, ſhould ſo abound, as to Strengthen <hi>Evil Inſinuations</hi> againſt me on that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57559:36"/>Account, I have this to ſay: That ſuch as have been of Party againſt us (concerned in the Publication hereof) have been the Firſt (and frequent) <hi>Promulgators</hi> by <hi>Declaration,</hi> by <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> and by <hi>Printing, That there have been Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the aforeſaid People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to a Publication thereof by <hi>Declaration,</hi> I refer to what I have already written in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> the <hi>Introduction</hi> to the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Fourth Parts</hi> of this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Publication thereof by Manuſcript,</hi> I referr to the <hi>Fourth Part,</hi> and in particular to the <hi>Title Page</hi> thereof; to the <hi>Forty Four Articles of Accuſation,</hi> drawn up againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> to the Paper ſubſcribed by <hi>Charles Marſhal</hi> and <hi>Sixty five</hi> more, at <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi> his Chamber; (both mentioned in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi>) to the
<note n="*" place="margin">Note, <hi>in the ſaid Paper, theſe Words (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to</hi> John Story <hi>and</hi> John Wilkinſon) <hi>are,</hi> viz. And we do hereby warn all, to have a Care, that they be not lifted up by reaſon of the Temptation and hurt that's come upon theſe Men, nor yet inſult over them: for that Spirit is not of God: but rather let all watch, in the Fear and Dread of Almighty God, againſt that Spirit, that they enter not into Temptation. <hi>The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid</hi> Words are <hi>cited to ſhew the</hi> Inconſiſtency <hi>of</hi> John Wilkinſon <hi>and</hi> John Story, <hi>their</hi> Oppoſers Actions <hi>with the</hi> aforeſaid Advice. <hi>For 'tis well known, that contray to the aforeſaid</hi> Counſel, <hi>Their</hi> Oppoſers have been ſo drunk with Prejudice, <hi>and an</hi> Inſulting Spirit, <hi>as that the ſaid</hi> Paper (<hi>called a</hi> Narrative) <hi>hath been read againſt them in ſeveral</hi> Counties, <hi>in</hi> publick Meetings <hi>for the</hi> Worſhip of God; <hi>from which</hi> Aſſemblies <hi>no</hi> Perſons <hi>whatſoever (though not profeſſing the Truth) are excluded. This</hi> Action <hi>may reaſonably be concluded</hi> to ſpring from the ſame Spirit, <hi>that dictated a few Lines ſubſcribed by</hi> George Fox, <hi>whereof mention is made in the Preface, directing</hi> to ſhew Certificates againſt <hi>John Story,</hi> both to Enemies and Friends.</note> Paper called <hi>The Brethrens Narrative</hi> at <hi>Drawel:</hi> And to an Epiſtle written by a publick Preacher (and one of Party againſt ſuch as are concerned in the Publication hereof, whoſe Name for the Reaſons mentioned in the Preface I omit) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to be read, (and accordingly was read) in a Publick Meeting for Worſhip of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> held in the great Meeting-Houſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57559:36"/>on the 21ſt. of the 11th. Month 1678. in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſeveral, not accounted to be of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> wherein mention is made of <hi>Rents, Schiſmes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Difference, Breach, Strife, Diſtraction, Diſcord, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, late and preſent Diviſion, and of a Seperation in ſome Parts of this Nation,</hi> on ſuch wiſe, as that in the Authors Senſe, 'tis Evident, that they are mentioned with relation to one party of Friends, amongſt thoſe who have profeſſed the Truth as rent and divided from another Party.</p>
                  <p>But that which on this Occaſion is chiefly my Concern, is to evidence that there hath been a Publication of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Diviſions in Print before the Publication hereof, and that by (and on the behalf of) ſome of <hi>George Fox's</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>On the 8th. Inſtant came to my Hands two Sheets of Printed Paper, Entituled <hi>An Epiſtle (pretended to be for true Love, Unity and Order in the Church of Chriſt, againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Diſcord, Diſorder and Confuſion.</hi> In the bottom of the Title Page thereof, 'tis thus written, <hi>Printed by</hi> Andrew Sowle, <hi>and are to be Sold at his Shop in</hi> Devonſhire Buildings, <hi>without</hi> Biſhopſgate, 1680.

                  <p>I ſhould now proceed to cite a few Sentences out of it, which amounts to a Publication of Diviſions.</p>

Page 'tis thus written: <hi>And a true Senſe hath been upon me of our Dear Friends up and down the Nation, of their great Tryal and Exerciſe that hath been upon them becauſe of this Wicked Dividing Spirit, and eſpecially in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57559:38"/>my Native Country,</hi> viz. <hi>Willſhire.</hi> Thus much out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Sheets, to manifeſt that this Treatiſe containes not the firſt printed and publiſhed Papers, evidencing <hi>Diviſions</hi> amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am now ſenſible ſome may be apt thus to Object. <hi>If the Meeting held on every Second Day, whereof thou makes mention, may be Juſtifyed, in approving the aforeſaid ſheels to be printed; yet it can be Plea to Juſtify thy Printing, becauſe thou haſt deſcended more particularly to deſcribe wherein the Difference doth conſiſt, and haſt mentioned ſome Names of both Parties concerned in the Difference. But in the aforecited Sheets, we find but ſome Names of one Party only,</hi> viz. <hi>G F. and the two Subſcribers of the ſaid two Sheets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs, the latter Part of the Objection to be true, but yet not ſufficient for any to condemn my printing, who may Juſtify the printing of the aforeſaid Sheets. For, if the mentioning of one particular Matter, wherein the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is reputed to conſiſt (even as in the ſaid Sheets it is) be according to Truth in <hi>one Party,</hi> I know not why the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of <hi>more</hi> may not be juſtifiable in the other <hi>Party;</hi> and if it be juſtifyable to mention a Part of the Names of one <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> concerned in the Difference, why not alſo of the other? And though in the aforeſaid Sheets, there is not ſo particular a Deſcription, wherein the Differences do conſiſt, as in this Treatiſe is mentioned. Yet the underſtanding Reader may collect many things of importance from it, and in particular, that in the Senſe of the Subſcribers thereof, and ſuch as are at Unity with them (who may reaſonably be taken to be of <hi>one Party</hi>) they are ſuch as are for True Love, Unity, Order of the Goſpel of Peace, Fellowſhip of the Spirit, Bowels of Mercy, and things that are True, Honeſt, Juſt, and a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the other <hi>Party</hi> whom they oppoſe, are ſuch as are for Diſorder, Confuſion, unto whom Blindneſs
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57559:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath happened, and that they are declined from their Firſt Love, having only the Sheeps-Cloathing, of Prejudiced Minds Oppoſing, Dividing, Confounding Order againſt the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Government of Chriſt; Envious Workers, that would raze at the very Foundation of Chriſts Government, Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Dignity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which leads me to this Obſervation, that ſince no matter of Fact is ſignifyed, to evidence any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Profeſſion of Truth worthy of thoſe General Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor yet any thing referred to for Evidence; I may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude, that the Intended Oppoſition to Chriſt's Government, is in their Senſe no other than a ſuppoſed <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to Womens-Meetings, diſtinct and ſeperate from Men;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find that a Diſlike to thoſe Meetings is the Chief Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treated on, which being duely weighed, ſeems to me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Unchriſtian-like ſo to reflect, as aforeſaid; eſpecially, when on ſuch, whoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Purſes</hi> have not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Adminiſter</hi> to the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of the <hi>Sick,</hi> the <hi>Weak,</hi> the <hi>Widdows</hi> and the <hi>Fatherleſs,</hi> which are the Ends declared in the aforeſaid Sheets, wherefore <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi> were ſet up, and adviſed to by <hi>George Fox.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, I now leave it to the <hi>Impartial Reader</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether the Method that is to be learned out of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited ſheets, or that in this Treatiſe, be moſt <hi>juſtifiable.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> being <hi>to praiſe themſelves,</hi> and <hi>defame others</hi> in a general way, without evidencing <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> worthy either of ſuch <hi>Praiſe</hi> on <hi>Defamation;</hi> and ſo conſequently can convince none, but ſuch as are ready to pin their <hi>Faiths</hi> on the <hi>Sleeves</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The other being a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> from <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Fact,</hi> leaves every <hi>Readers Judgement</hi> free.</p>

                     <p>TIs well remembred, that that <hi>one Man</hi> G. F. went ſome years paſt into many parts of this Nation, adviſing Friends to hold ſuch Meetings, viz. <hi>Monthly,</hi> and <hi>Quarterly;</hi> and in many places his Counſel was readily embraced: but for our parts, we underſtood not at that day, that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by him, or any elſe, that thoſe Meetings ſhould not only be accounted the <hi>Church,</hi> but alſo ſuch as profeſſed the Truth, <hi>ought to believe as this Church believes;</hi> had he ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt himſelf, Teſtimonies would have ariſen as a Flood againſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57559:50"/>ſuch Darkneſs; for this would have plainly appeared to us, to have opened a Door, whereby that <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Rubbiſh, which we had been long teſtifying againſt, might have been exalted in one day. And to be very plain, we cannot but now declare, that we are fully ſatisfied in our Conſciences, that by this very Door, a Body of <hi>Strife, Contention, Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Malice,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> together with a <hi>Rending, Dividing Seperate Spirit</hi> from the Truth, is entred amongſt many hundreds, who before walked together with us in an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Union and Fellowſhip, in the Life of Righteouſneſs; which doubtleſs may (if it hath not already) occaſion many Honeſt Simple-hearted Friends thus in their Hearts to ſay; <hi>[Where are the People whom we ſhall now follow?]</hi> But if ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the Sanctuary of the Lord, there in ſtilneſs to wait what God will ſay, they will undoubtedly have this Anſwer; <hi>[You have a Teacher within you, which cannot be removed into a Corner; follow that Teacher, leſt peradventer your Feet do ſlip, by going from your Inward Guide, and following the Footſteps and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Man.]</hi>

                        <head>What Order is either preſcribed or uſed, whereby the ſenſe of ſuch Meetings is collected.?</head>
                        <p>To this we ſay;</p>
                        <p>An eminent Perſon profeſſing Truth being at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> did take occaſion to ſignify, at a Mens-Meeting held in that City, to this effect; <hi>That in</hi> London, <hi>and other parts of this Nation, where ſuch Meetings were uſually held, the ſenſe of the generallity hath been taken for the ſenſe of ſuch Meetings;</hi> Comparing this with this Doctrine frequently of late publiſht amongſt us, <hi>That the Apoſtacy ſhall never enter the generality more,</hi> doth give us Juſt occaſion to be Jealous, that our oppoſers, for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of their deſigns againſt us, have contrived this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of carrying all things by the <hi>generality,</hi> or <hi>major</hi> number of voices; which Limitation, we know hath been heretofore (and by the faithfull to this day) utterly diſowned, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Truth; and alſo by the approvers of R. B's. <hi>Book of Government,</hi> as in Page 81. and though the counſel of that one man, who firſt adviſed to the aforeſaid Meetings in ſome parts, was on this wiſe, <hi>Chooſe from amongst you the faithfull;</hi> yet ſuch a limitation we have cauſe to believe, will not now be born by ſome; 'tis well if the ground thereof in our oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be not to bring in the <hi>multitude,</hi> if they can, and that under a pretence, that all Friends in Truth may have free acceſs, that ſo the <hi>Generality</hi> may be on their ſide: for of late Mens Meetings are known to conſiſt of many ſuch, who, if any ought to be <hi>Governed,</hi> are much fitter to be <hi>Governed,</hi> then appear as <hi>Governours,</hi> and who (we are well ſatisfied in our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) would of themſelves be more modeſt than to appear in ſuch Meetings, as Governours, were they not prompted to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57559:51"/>there; The ſecret end thereof (as we have cauſe to doubt) is for the carying on that which we believe Truth will never own.</p>
                        <p>And as to the Apoſtacy never entering the generality more, we ſay; may the Lord preſerve us all ſo ſtayd in his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable Truth, as that we may never apoſtatiſe from it, nor be drawn away from the hope of the Goſpel, by falſe Prophets and ſeducing Spirits; for we do firmly believe that as many of thoſe, who formerly were in the Truth, and do now account us <hi>Dark Spirits,</hi> becauſe we cannot be at Unity with them, in ſuch actions as we account Perſecution againſt antient Brethern, are already Apoſtatized: and doubtleſs they with their adherents account themſelves the generality; yet we hope better things than ſo.</p>
                        <p>We now come to ſay ſomthing to theſe foregoing words, viz. <hi>That in</hi> London <hi>and other part of this Nation, where ſuch Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings where uſually held, the ſenſe of the Generallity hath been taken for the ſenſe of ſuch Meetings.</hi> To this we anſwer, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is intended, that the generality may claim power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that their ſenſe is the ſenſe of the Meeting, it opens a Door whereby the Reputation and Honour of Truth, as Profeſt, owned and practized amongſt the Freinds thereof, may fall in one day; For when theſe Meetings were aſſented unto (we cannot ſay eſtabliſht by any man) we lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves all Servants one unto another, and not Maſters and Rulersover one another; and ſo had then no occaſion given us to diſcourſe of Authority, but when there was, we well Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that we, aſcribed all Authority unto the appearance of the inviſible Power of God; and ſo no encouragment was given by us, that any one Man or Men ſhould take upon him or them, to Rule and Govern in ſuch Meetings; but our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were, that every Member ſhould there appear in ſubjection to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Head and higher Power, unto which as Members of his Body we owe Obedience: In this ſenſe we readily embraced the Counſel, to Meet together to <hi>Serve,</hi>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57559:52"/>but not <hi>to Bear Rule</hi> over one another's Conſciences: and the matters intended by us to be tranſacted in thoſe Meetings, and by others alſo (as far as we underſtood) were chiefly, <hi>To take care of the poor, the fatherleſs and the widdow.</hi> And that if any profeſſed the Truth, and diſhonour'd the ſame by prophane and evil Converſation, we might by ſuch ways and meanes, as the Lord on every occaſion might direct, (not then thinking that the day would ever come, wherein an Outward Directory ſhould be placed as a Judg over our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences) Indeavor to reclaim ſuch from the Evil of their Ways; and for theſe Services we are ſenſible, that Meetings are proper, and therefore do continue in the ſervices thereof: yet never thought that we ſhould have ſeen the Day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any profeſſing the truth would have attempted to treat on ſuch a Subject as this, viz. <hi>[How far doth this Government extend in matters Spiritual, and purely conſcientious?]</hi> and not only ſo but be approved (as the aforeſaid <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> wherein the ſaid ſentence is written, hath been) by a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that takes upon them to take Care (as they pretend) that nothing be Printed whereby the Truth may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd.</p>
                        <p>Alas! Friends, can ſuch appear to us as men ſtaid in the Unchangable Truth, who have ſuffered and highly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt alone is Lord over it,</hi> and is its only Lawgiver; and yet now reckon that Mens-Meetings (which we, or at leaſt ſeveral of us, do know, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been much converſant therein, even from the begining, to this day, have moſt uſually conſiſted of Men <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain in Numbers</hi> as well as to <hi>Qualifications</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi>) may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a Power over Conſcience, under the Notion of the Church of Chriſt. Truly Friends, we cannot but teſtify, that our Souls have no Unity with ſuch things; and cannot but look upon the Promoters thereof, as <hi>Lovers of Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, more than Lovers of God;</hi> having let in a <hi>dark, ſeperate, rending, dividing Spirit</hi> from the Truth, and opened a Door, whereby as great Darkneſs may be brought over the People,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57559:52"/>As ever was in any Age under the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Objection,</hi> But perhaps ſome perſons may thus <hi>Object, We cannot but have more Charity for ſome, at leaſt, of thoſe who are concerned in theſe things you ſtrike at, and cannot believe they intend an impoſition on any of our Conſciences; for when we have been in Meetings with them, we have been Witneſſes that the Life hath been raiſed, and our Souls have been refreſhed through their Miniſtry; and in their Epiſtles they tell us, how eminently the Lord appears amongſt them, unto which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but give Credit, becauſe when they are with us, the Life in us anſwers to the Life in them, as Face anſwers Face in a Glaſſe; but when thoſe whom they oppoſe, do ſpeak, then Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Dryneſs, and Barrenneſs appears: beſides, many of the Miniſtring Friends have exhorted us (and as they ſay) in the Name of the Lord, that we ought to ſhut out Jealouſies, the Reaſoning, and the Wiſdom; telling us</hi> (as before is hinted) <hi>That the Apoſtacy ſhall never enter the generality more, and that we ought to have an eye to the Brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>Objection</hi> may ſeem very weighty with ſome, eſpecially ſuch who may conclude, that if they are of the true Brotherhood, the Lord will give them an inward ſenſe, when they wait upon him, whereby a Teſtimony according to the Truth may ariſe from them in every Caſe, wherein they may Concern their thoughts; but alas! 'tis either the fruit of Weakneſs or Preſumption ſo to conclude, with reſpect to every Brother, in what eſtate ſoever, which hath been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evidenced to us by the Fruits of thoſe, <hi>who have taken upon them to Judge the Merit of a Cauſe, without hearing of both Parties,</hi> (of which more anon) Beſides, if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Scriptures of Truth do teſtify, <hi>there are diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gifts, diverſities of Adminiſtrations, and Operations, and yet by the ſame Spirit,</hi> it were ſufficient to prompt us to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57559:53"/>ſo Serious, and weighty in this day of Tryal, as to be found waiting every one in his own Gift, that ſo all may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and not meddle with things that are too high for them.</p>
                        <p>He that is not ſenſible of the Danger in running beyond his Gift, and is ſo puft up with Spiritual Pride, as to conclude himſelf more Faithful, more Holy, more Circumſpect, more Diſcerning than his Brother, thinking of himſelf not only better than of his Brother, but in other things above what is meet, contrary to the Counſel of the Apoſtle, who exhorted, <hi>Not to think of our ſelves more highly than we ought;</hi> may eaſily run himſelf on this Rock of Judging thoſe, whom the Lord Judgeth not; eſpecially if ſuch an one give himſelf liberty to Judge from an apprehended Inward Senſe, grounded on no Outward Knowledge, or Evidence.</p>
                        <p>That now which is with us farther to ſignify in relation to this matter, is this, we have great cauſe to doubt that this kind of Weakneſs, or Preſumption hath been, and is yet like to be one meanes, by which the variance amongſt ſuch as have been formerly at Unity may continue; becauſe 'tis well known that when Teſtimonies have ariſen againſt ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in publick, as <hi>dark, ſeperate,</hi> and <hi>dividing Spirits,</hi> and that ſome ſuch as have been diſſatisfy'd, have deſired to know what is the <hi>Matter,</hi> and what is the <hi>Fruit</hi> whereby it may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced? The Anſwer commonly is, <hi>Let the Teſtimonyes of Friends ariſe:</hi> this <hi>Word</hi> when it Springs from ſuch, who have been Inſtruments to beget into this Faith, <hi>that we ought to ſhut out the Reaſoning, the Wiſdom and Jealouſy</hi> (and that without diſtinction) and that the Apoſtacy ſhall never enter <hi>the Generality more;</hi> and that <hi>we ought to have an eye to the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>We would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that 'tis not fit to have an Eye to faithful Brethren in any thing; but yet we cannot but take notice, that it ſounds not very comely out of the mouthes of thoſe, with reſpect to themſelves, who have in publick frequently thus Teſtified,</hi> [We Preach not our ſelves, look not unto us, but unto the Lord, and the meaſure of his Grace in your ſelves, that's given to you to profit withal.]</note> Brethren,</hi> eaſily raiſes the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57559:53"/>like Teſtimony, that ſuch an one is <hi>of a dark, ſeperate Spirit;</hi> and then this comes to be ſpread abroad, as a Seal to that which cannot be evidenced either by Doctrine or Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as if the Tree were not now to be known by its Fruit, as in daies paſt; and ſo whilſt they have been in the Exerciſe of one part of the Counſel, <hi>viz.</hi> Excluding the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (by which means ſome have been betrayed to act contrary to <hi>all Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>all Wiſdom</hi>) they have acted contrary to the other part of the counſel which was to ſhut out the <hi>Jealouſy:</hi> For had they not entertained Unrighteous Jealouſy, we are perſwaded, that they would not have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt ſuch, as have approved themſelves unto us no other, then Faithful Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Sound in Doctrine, and as Blamleſs in Converſation (ſo far as ever we knew) as any Friends.</p>
                        <p>And thus the Variance, we fear, is but too likely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Now we appeal to the Witneſs of God, <hi>Whether this kind of proceeding be not the Fruit of</hi> a Dark, Rending Spirit, <hi>that ſeperates from the Truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to come a little nearer to anſwer other parts of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, viz. <hi>When we have been in Meetings with them, we have been Witneſſes, that the Life hath been raiſed, and our ſoules have been refreſhed; and that When thoſe whom they oppoſe do ſpeake, nothing but Dryneſs, Deadneſs, and Barrenneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We deſire every one who may thus affirm, ſeriouſly to weigh and conſider:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether, if contrary to thine own Principle, thou haſt let in Jealouſy, this Jealouſy may not darken thee, ſo as to take <hi>Light</hi> for <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> for <hi>Light;</hi> and that to be <hi>True Refreſhment,</hi> which is no other, but <hi>a rejoycing in thoſe imaginary ſparks, which thou by a falſe fire haſt kindled:</hi> for when the eye is not ſingle to God, and fixt upon that Teacher that cannot be removed into a Corner, but inſtead thereof, haſt an eye unto man, and to things that are without,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57559:54"/>weighing not the matters wherein thy mind is concerned in the equal Ballance of the Sanctuary) it may be Juſt with the Lord to ſuffer thee to be overſhadowed with a Vail of Darkneſs, and to become ignorant of the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, as they who are without are, <hi>leſt thou ſee with thine eye, and underſtand with thy heart, and be converted and ſaved, even as it was ſaid by Chriſt himſelf concerning them who are without, Mark,</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
                        <p>For we know, that when Truth was Preach't amongſt us in the beginning, and the Light of Chriſt Jeſus ſhining in our Conſciences magnified as our only Guide (the Gift of the Father) and Appearance of Chriſt Jeſus, the great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Power of God unto Salvation) our ſouls were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully reacht, and affected with the ſound thereof; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that the day was then come unto us, wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Father, according to the Words of Chriſt, was fulfilled unto us, <hi>viz. But the Comforter, which is the Spirit of Truth, which the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall Teach you all things, and Guide you into all Truth:</hi> And thus the Eyes of our Underſtandings came to be opened, that we ſaw moſt of the Profeſſours (then in being) to be but in the <hi>Gentile</hi> nature, and come no further than the Outward Court, which the Angel (as <hi>John</hi> Teſtified) was not to meaſure: for was not their <hi>Preacher</hi> Outward, their <hi>Rule</hi> Outward, their <hi>Order</hi> Outward, their <hi>Ordinances</hi> Outward, and the <hi>Tokens,</hi> and <hi>Marks of Memberſhip</hi> in their Church Outward? And when thoſe <hi>Outward Things</hi> were magnified, and the Preaching of the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, as the Guide to the Father, degraded by our Oppoſers, we were even ready to fear (on their behalf) that they were of that number, who <hi>ſaw,</hi> but did not <hi>perceive;</hi> did <hi>hear,</hi> but not <hi>underſtand.</hi> Our breathing now unto the Lord is, That none of thoſe, who have formerly received the Truth in the Love thereof, may continue ſo hardened, as to <hi>ſee</hi> and not <hi>Perceive;</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> and not <hi>Underſtand;</hi> and ſo (in a dark and vailed Eſtate)

                        <p>This ſeems not ſtrange unto us; for the Apoſtle thus Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>We are unto God a ſweet Savour of Chriſt in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh; to the one we are the Savour of Death unto Death, and to the other the Savour of Life unto Life:</hi> This give us occaſion to put every one that has or may Judge the ſound form of words to be Deadneſs, Dryneſs &amp; Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (eſpecially when Springing from ſuch whom thou haſt known to be in the Life) upon this ſearch; is not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, <hi>becauſe I am watching for evil, and have let in a Spirit of Prejudice, believing an evil Report, when perhaps it may not be Truth?</hi> If this be thy State we muſt plainly tell thee, they are the very Tokens of a <hi>Periſhing Condition,</hi> and then, though it be the Word of Life that is Preached, yet it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57559:55"/>can be no other (according to the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle) but the <hi>Savour of Death unto thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides, we have this further Obſervation to make, that ſome [at leaſt] of thoſe, thus Teſtified againſt, as Dead, Dry and Barren, are chiefly ſuch unto whom God hath given a <hi>Portion of Underſtanding above many of their Brethren,</hi> and have, and yet do (as far as ever we know) appear <hi>Sound in Doctrine,</hi> and as <hi>blameleſs in Life and Converſation as any friends, we have ever known;</hi> and ſo cannot run with the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Times: we deſire therefore that every one of the Oppoſers of, or Judges over ſuch, will yet more thoroughly ſearch their own Conſciences, and in a Godly Jealouſy over themſelves put theſe queries unto their own hearts, and try things in the equal ballance.</p>
                        <p>Have not I many times heard <hi>Unſound Doctrines,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <hi>Diſorder and Confuſion</hi> brought forth even in Publick Meetings for worſhip by thoſe, who cry againſt Dark, Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Spirits; and yet not been a Reproof thereto, Conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notwithſtanding that there did a Freſhneſs and Life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?</p>
                        <p>Have not I been often affected with an <hi>Outward Tone,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength of Lungs,</hi> when there hath been little to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Building up one another in the moſt Holy Faith?</p>
                        <p>Have not I been better Contented to hear a <hi>Thundering kind of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oice</hi> Crying out againſt a Seperate Spirit, (though without Diſtinction) when not a word was ſpoken to ſhew the Way to the Kingdom, than to hear the Way of Eternal Life Plainly Demonſtrated by a ſoft, and moderate Voice?</p>
                        <p>We know there is great cauſe for many to put theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their Conſciences, and to be <hi>cool in Spirit</hi> that ſo they may have an Anſwer from the Lord, whoſe appearance is not in the ſtrong winds, but in the ſtill Voice.</p>

That 'tis Folly and Hipocriſy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſelves Members of the True Church, and yet not Believe thus, as the True Church Believes.</head>
                     <p>TO this we ſay, we are altogether diſſatisfied (eſpecially when we conſider what a Body of darkneſs hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered under the Belief of this Poſition <hi>[we muſt believe as the Church believes]</hi> amongſt the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity in Ages paſt, as well as at this preſent Day) that ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage can become the mouth, or pen of any one, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth not only Faith in Chriſt, but alſo that ſuch his Faith is grounded upon the Inward Manifeſtation and Revelation of Gods Spirit in <hi>himſelf</hi> [mark] we ſay <hi>in himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are accounted Apoſtate Chriſtians, have from ſuch Aſſemblies, which they call their Church, ſet forth their Creeds, by which it may be known, what the Members of their Church do and <hi>ought to Believe;</hi> and ſince 'tis ſo, that no Perſon is able to make out, that ever any Aſſembly under the Notion of the true Church, amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have publiſhed their Creed, by which we mean a certain number of Articles of Faith, recommending them as thoſe things which every Member of the true Church ought to believe, or elſe not be accounted a Member of the true Church, we cannot account it unreaſonable, if any one that liketh not the Language touching <hi>Believing as the true Church Believes,</hi> ſhould ask the Publiſher thereof this Queſtion, <hi>Haſt thou not ſpoken this with reſpect to the People called Quakers,</hi> as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57559:56"/>thoſe whom thou accounteſt the True Church? And if ſo, is it not folly to talk of believing as this Church believes, when no aſſembly under the notion of this Church have to this day declared, and publiſhed their Creed, for the ends aforeſaid? Nay, may it not further be ſaid, we know how Papiſts and Proteſtants deſcribe their Church, but at the day wherein that which occaſions this preſent diſcourſe was given forth, it was not diſcovered by any reputed <hi>Quakers,</hi> publickly in Print (that we know of) who or were the true Church is, with reſpect to viſible perſons, more than what is to this effect given forth by the Author, occaſioning this preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, viz. <hi>That the People called Quakers are the Church.</hi> Wherein we do not take his meaning to be, that <hi>all called Quakers</hi> were the Church of God, but the <hi>Elect</hi> amongſt them; for he alſo ſaith, <hi>The Church ſignifies the Elect;</hi> and ſo the Reader is left without any certain Deſcription who or where this Church is, with reſpect to <hi>viſible Perſons;</hi> ſince the <hi>Elect</hi> amongſt them are not outwardly deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>For the clearing of the Truth, and the opening of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of ſuch, as may be muddled about this matter, 'tis with us thus to Teſtifie:</p>
                     <p>'Tis well known, that it pleaſed the Lord, to reach unto many of our Conſciences at the beginning of this latter Day, that hath dawned amongſt us; whereby we came to Believe in the Everlaſting Light of the Lord; and as others held forth the <hi>Viſible Orders,</hi> and <hi>Written Faiths</hi> of a <hi>Viſible Church</hi> to be as a <hi>Lanthorn to their Paths,</hi> and as a <hi>Ground of their Faith,</hi> ſo this <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was preach't up as a <hi>Lanthorn to our Paths,</hi> and as the <hi>Ground of our Faith,</hi> and then (as our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings came to be more and more opened) we clearly ſaw, that as other Churches had <hi>outward Marks</hi> and <hi>Tokens,</hi> whereby a man might manifeſt himſelf to be a Member of their Church, when received into Society with their Church, ſo we (who had Believed in the <hi>Light</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and had the Evidence in our ſelves, that we were of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57559:56"/>the true Brotherhood, and Members of Chriſt's Body) were at a loſs infallibly to manifeſt unto others, by any <hi>Outward Marks</hi> or <hi>Tokens,</hi> that we were in Reality <hi>Members of the true Church:</hi> Becauſe this Light (in which we had Believed) did reveal unto us, <hi>that thoſe who were but in the Gentile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and had come no further than the Outward Court (that was given to the Gentiles) might have all the Outward Marks and ſigns of a Member of their Churches, and yet know very little of the waſhing by the Water of Regeneration, and Sanctification through the Spirit, which every Member of the true Church, that's Built on the Rock Chriſt, comes to be Witneſs of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore, when our Oppoſers (who profeſſed not the Truth) would reflect upon us on this wiſe; <hi>You are a confuſed People; you gather not into Church-fellowſhips; you have no certain Way to know one another to be Members of the Church, as we have. And why do you not put forth your Creed, that ſo we may know what and how many the Articles of your Faith are, and what you ſtand for, and what you ſtand againſt?</hi> The beſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that ever (as we could underſtand) we were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give in Truth unto ſuch, was this:</p>
                     <p>The True Church is in God, who is the Author and Finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Faith; we have believed in the Sufficiency of his Grace, unto which, if we are obedient (according to the reſpective meaſures thereof given of God, and Received by us) we then have the Witneſs of God in our Conſciences, giving Evidence, that we are of the True Brotherhood, and of the Church of the Firſt Born, whoſe Names are written in Heaven, though we do not alleadge any outward Marks and Signes, whereby our Bodies (being Temples wherein the Holy Ghoſt doth dwell) ought to be accounted within the pale of the true Church. And albeit no Outward Society of Men amongſt us, calling themſelves the <hi>Church,</hi> have put forth any certain number of Articles of Faith, with this Teſtimony, that every one that profeſſeth himſelf a Member of the Church of Chriſt ought ſo to Believe, or elſe not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57559:57"/>of the <hi>True Church;</hi> yet many of our Freinds, unto whom the Lord hath given Divine Underſtanding, have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten divers Books (according as the Spirit of the Lord hath moved upon their Hearts) out of which the ſound Doctrines we hold, and ſtand for, may be collected; though others, ſo reputed may (thorough Weakneſs) have erred. To conclude as to this particular we further thus teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>In the Church of Chriſt, there are <hi>Babes, Young Men,</hi> and <hi>Fathers;</hi> there are the <hi>Weak,</hi> and the <hi>Strong:</hi> Suppoſe a Weak Brothers Faith Differs from his Brethren, muſt he be accounted <hi>a Fool,</hi> or an <hi>Hipocrite?</hi> Nay; Nay, Charity meaſures not ſo.</p>
                     <p>We find this very Caſe happening amongſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> and what ſaid Paul in that Caſe? Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3, 4, 22, 23. and there <hi>Paul</hi> thus adviſeth; <hi>Let not him that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, diſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not, Judge him which eateth; for God hath received him. Who art thou, that condemneſt another Man's Servant? To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth: Haſt thou Faith? Have it to thy ſelf. He that doubteth, is condemned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith; and whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence 'tis evident, the Members of the Church differed in their Faith; he that did eat, was not to be Judged, becauſe he was <hi>Received of God;</hi> he that did not eat, was ſo far from being Judged, that the Apoſtle condemnes the very eating, whileſt there was <hi>a Doubt:</hi> though the abſtaining from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was the Fruit of Weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>We now leave it to the Conſcience of every Impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus to weigh and conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be Service to the Truth, and agreeable to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit at this day, for any perſon under the name of <hi>Quaker,</hi> to give forth this Doctrine, <hi>'tis folly and hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy to profeſs our ſelves Members of the True Church, and yet not believe thus, as the True Church believes,</hi> though the giver forth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57559:57"/>thereof may to this purpoſe alſo declare (as to give the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher thereof his due, he hath) <hi>That they never did preach up ſuch a Poſition as a great Argument to enforce People into their Faith.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57559:58"/>Doctrines, and Practices: but foraſmuch as that hath largely been treated on by many antient &amp; honourable Friends to Truth and Righteouſneſs (who were Inſtruments in Gods Hand to gather us into the Belief of his Light, and Sufficiency of his Grace, though ſince fallen aſleep) and that we intend more particularly to treat thereon in the ſecond part of this Treatiſe; we ſhall not much enlarge thereon in this part; yet think it neceſſary for the ſakes of ſome, here to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: That Truth and Righteouſneſs (for which we ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Government of Chriſt</hi>) hath Inſtructed us, not to depend on <hi>Man</hi> for teaching; but on the <hi>Sufficiency of Gods Grace;</hi> nor yet to put into the mouths of falſe Prophets, or Hireling Shepherds; and on this foot we have had a Teſtimony againſt paying of <hi>Tythes,</hi> as being that Antichriſtian-Yoak, which in the dark Night of Apoſtacy hath been ſpread over Nations; and as we came to believe in the <hi>Light of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and to depend upon the <hi>Sufficiency of his Grace,</hi> and to know the <hi>benefit of our aſſembling our ſelves together, to wait upon the Lord, for the ariſing of his pure immortal Life, to the refreſhing and conſolating our immortal Souls,</hi> we have been made willing (Praiſes be to our God) to continue the aſſembling of our Selves together, waiting upon the Lord in the day of Perſecution, and Hour of Tryal, though Sufferings might therefore attend; believing, that <hi>whatſoever ſociety of People had been in the Life of Chriſtianity, and yet ſhould for Fear of Man, or the Lawes of Men, forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together</hi> (as the manner of ſome hath been in dayes paſt) <hi>when the will of the Lord was they ſhould not forbear, might thereby come to loſe their ſtrength in the Lord:</hi> for that we believe, 'tis the duty of every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to think nothing too dear to offer up for the Lord, when he commands, or calls for it; [Mark, We do not ſay, at every time that any <hi>Informer,</hi> that thirſteth after our <hi>ruin</hi> and <hi>Eſtates,</hi> thorough Malice (eſpecially when not prompted thereto by ſuch as are Miniſters of the Law) calls for it, but we ſay

But, alas! this is far remote from the Caſes reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on; becauſe ſome Perſons therein concerned have received no Command from God to the contrary, nor yet have ſaved any thing which the Lord commanded to deſtroy: And therefore ſuch may juſtly thus ſay; <hi>How dareſt thou to Judge the Friends of Truth, and Servants of the Lord, for that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are not Judged of the Lord?</hi> Beſides, 'tis worthy Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that if any ſhould go beyond their proper Gift, and Line of right Underſtanding, and in that ſtate offer up their <hi>ALL, when the Lord calls not for it,</hi> but inſtead thereof <hi>a Company of Informers,</hi> and that alſo by Illegal Ways, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it on their Luſts, this <hi>Offering</hi> might have no more <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Lord,</hi> under this Diſpenſation of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, than the Offering of the <hi>Blind</hi> and the <hi>Lame</hi> under the Firſt Covenant had. And indeed, it may not be unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, farther to confide, the <hi>End</hi> wherefore the Lord hath made us Stewards of Worldly Eſtates; doubtleſs 'twas and is, that therewith we might <hi>Maintain</hi> our <hi>Families,</hi> and have a

                        <hi>due regard to the Poor, the Fatherleſs and the Widow,</hi> that are or might be Objects of Charity: and therefore it may well be deemed not contrary to the Truth, Lawfully to preſerve the ſame, for the Ends for which 'twas given, and to endeavour by all <hi>Lawful Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> to prevent the Spoylers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of poſſeſſing our Eſtates to conſume it on their Luſts. And indeed, Charity obligeth us to ſuppoſe, that theſe very Conſiderations occaſioned <hi>G.

For who dares to be ſo uncharitable as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>That none who are fallen aſleep, that taſteth not of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in their day, nor had occaſion offered for the ſpoyling of their goods for the Goſpels Sake, Dyed in the Faith of Gods Elect, and of the number of thoſe who lived Godly in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; eſpecially ſince we know it hath been the practice of ſome (who have been apt to reflect as aforeſaid)</hi> to uſe divers wayes and meanes (according to the beſt of their Skill and Underſtandings) to prevent the <hi>Stroke of Perſecution in their day?</hi>

                     <p>Beſides, we cannot on this occaſion but obſerve, that the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſufficiently evidence his diſlike of any Plea for <hi>Unity,</hi> ſave that of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace: And though he exhorts to Unity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3. yet <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. he ſaith, <hi>But unto every one of us is given Grace, according to the meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt;</hi> which clearly evidences to our Conſciences, that <hi>Paul</hi> never intended to magnify any

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57559:65"/>us) to the Grace of God, and the Teachings thereof, as manifeſt in every ones Inward Parts; making no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having their <hi>Dependencies</hi> on <hi>General, Quarterly Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or any other <hi>Meetings of Men</hi> whatſoever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot but give forth this as <hi>a warning</hi> to all, to take heed, that ye be not deceived by the cunning Sleights and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of <hi>Man,</hi> to leave your Teacher, that cannot be removed into a Corner; and inſtead thereof be found depending on the Dicttates, and Preſcriptions of fallible Man. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to come yet more cloſe to the matter in hand; we cannot but further declare, that though the Replier thus hath ſaid, <hi>To talk of Cityes, Places or Countryes by way of limitation, is narrow weak and unſound; it is a plain reſtraint; it is of the nature of Impoſition;</hi> yet we muſt take Liberty to tell him, that we are not ſo void of ſenſe, but to perceive, that the <hi>General Meeting</hi> is that unto which, in the ſenſe of ſome, all Friends ought to have an Eye, above any other Meeting of Friends whatſoever; and that the meaning of this Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, frequently uttered, <hi>viz.</hi> Have any Eye to the Brethren, is chiefly mean't with reſpect to that Meeting; this we take to be both <hi>Limitation,</hi> and a Deſign of <hi>Impoſition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas the Replier hath ſaid, <hi>Hereby one Place will be ignorant of the Actions of another;</hi> as if that were matter of ill conſequence; we think meet to add, that we do know, thoſe who have buſied themſelves, firſt to bring the Actions at <hi>one Place</hi> unto <hi>another,</hi> have occaſioned <hi>Emulation, Strife,</hi> and <hi>Diviſion</hi> amongſt Friends at Unity. So that inſtead of approving themſelves <hi>Keepers of other Mens Vineyards,</hi> they have been <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> both of <hi>other mens</hi> and their <hi>own Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards</hi> too, as by ſad Examples is too too evidently manifeſted, in the Countries and Places where we Live, or have been Converſant.</p>
                     <p>If report be True, it hath been Jealouſed by ſome, who cry much againſt ſome others, under the term of <hi>Dark Spirits</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57559:65"/>(though Honeſt Friends) <hi>That this kind of arguing, to leave Friends to the Grace, Light and Spirit of God, may lead into Rantiſm; and therefore 'tis the Care of Faithful Brethren to appear as watch-men over the Flock, that ſo none under pretence of being left to the Light, may run into Looſneſs, Lightneſs and Vanity; ſaying, The Light in my Conſcience Condemns me not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this we ſay the Lord rebuke that Spirit, that doth ſo much as Jealous, that leaving People to the <hi>Light,</hi> may lead into <hi>Rantiſm:</hi> ſuch a Sugeſtion is notoriouſly wicked, ſince the Teſtimony of Truth hath been (unto which we this day bear record) that <hi>the Light is a Reprover of all Sin.</hi> And as to the latter part of the <hi>Objection</hi> we ſay, That thoſe who are true Watchmen, will as much as in them lyes uſe their Endeavours to bring the Flock to the Light, to prove their Deeds, whether they are wrought in God (and not to Papers, rather than to the Light) as knowing this, that every <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> brought forth by <hi>Man,</hi> is but the <hi>Effect</hi> of what is firſt wrought in the <hi>Heart,</hi> which nothing outward can be a Bond upon to alter, and change: and if we do but conſider how Fruitleſs in daies and years that are paſt, as well as in this preſent Age, all <hi>Mans Outward endeavours</hi> under the notion of <hi>Church-Government</hi> hath been, to preſerve in a real, true, Heavenly Society, it appears to us as a meer <hi>Badge of Apoſtacy,</hi> for any to have a <hi>Dependency</hi> on any ſuch meanes of Preſervation. And whereas it's Jealous'd, <hi>Some may run into looſneſs, and ſay, the Light in my Conſcience condemns me not; and therefore tis the care of Faithful Brethren to appear, as Watchmen over the Flock:</hi> We ſay ſo too; and thoſe who approve themſelves Watchmen, will endeavour to convince ſuch, who in very deed run into Looſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that though they may pretend the Light condemns them not, yet that their deeds are Evil, and that the Light doth condemn that ſame, though they may be hardened, and ſee it not; and ſo endeavour to awaken the Conſcience, that Gods
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57559:66"/>Witneſs may be heard; for that nothing that is outward can be a Bond on ſuch an one, to forſake his Sin; and imbrace the Truth.</p>

                     <head>SECT. VII. <hi>Touching</hi> Church-Government, <hi>and the meaning of the word</hi> Church-Government, <hi>in the ſence of our Oppoſers, as we (on ſufficient ground) take it laid down. Our denial of that meaning. Several Scriptures from whence a Proof for</hi> Church-Government <hi>hath been pretended, are treated on, ſhewing that from thence no Pretence can be to claim a Power over Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Outward Property.

An</hi> Objection <hi>raiſed to this purpoſe,</hi> That what is given forth by the Spirit, through the Brethren, ought to be obeyed, and not accounted the Dictates of fallible Man; and that, if thou ſee it not thy Duty to obey, the Reaſon is, thy Want of Diligence, and not waiting in thy Meaſure, and ſo no Plea for thy Diſobedience is Good. <hi>The ſaid</hi> Objection <hi>anſwered. An Examination from the Scriptures, Whether Chriſt gave any Incouragement to his Diſciples, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Rulers over one another.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis kind of Diſcourſe we are ready to ſuppoſe may at length occaſion from ſome, ſuch an <hi>Objection</hi> as this:</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>What, are you not for</hi> Church-Government?</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we ſay, We are for the <hi>Government of Chriſt,</hi> knowing 'tis his Right to Govern his Church.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>This</hi> (may ſome ſay) <hi>is an evaſive Anſwer to the Queſtion, and therefore may again reply; Be plain, and tell us, Are you for</hi> Church-Government?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer then we ſay; We ought to ask, what is meant by the word <hi>Church-Government?</hi> Since we find not the word in the Scriptures of Truth; and it being a word, moſtly uſed under the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by ſuch who have become Perſecutors; we are the more Jealous that Corruption, Uſurpation, and Injuſtice may creep in by ſuch, who contend ſo much for <hi>Church-Government,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Outwards Forms</hi> of <hi>Government;</hi> ſince the Form ſome take to Govern is in ſome reſpect worſe than the Forms of Divers <hi>Apoſtate Chriſtians;</hi> take this for one inſtance amongſt many more, that might be given, <hi>viz. Judging the Merit of a Cauſe, without hearing both parties,</hi> as may be ſufficiently evidenced by the giving forth that Paper from <hi>Ellis Hookes</hi> his Chamber, <hi>London,</hi> the Twelfth of the Fourth Month 1677. and Subſcribed by <hi>Charles Marſhal</hi> and Sixty Five Perſons more, againſt two Antient and Honourable Brethren viz. <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> though not then preſent to ſpeak for themſelves, nor yet ever ſpoken to by many of the ſaid Sixty Six touching, any Evil laid to their Charge.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we do know, that many of our Oppoſers, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us highly affected with <hi>Church-Government</hi> (as in their account is eſtabliſhed amongſt us) and that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Outward Formes, do in an high decree manifeſt a Spirit of Perſecution, by endeavouring to take away the good name of honeſt men, by Lyes, Slanders, and Falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations (wherein our Oppoſers have been to our certain knowledge, ſo induſtrious, as that we have ſcarcily known
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57559:67"/>their <hi>Peers</hi> in that evil Work) which in many Sections of the Second Part of the firſt <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> made mention of in the Preface (Particularly the 13th, 18th, 12th, 22th.) is laregly evidenced, and ready for the view of any Freind that may deſire the peruſal thereof, though for the reaſons mentioned in the Preface, not herewith publiſht.</p>
                     <p>And, now as to the meaning of the word <hi>Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (in the ſenſe of our Oppoſers) we take it to be thus, viz. <hi>That ſome who account themſelves Members of the Body of Chriſt, claime a Power to Rule over other ſome, if not all the reſt, and to give forth Sentences, Directions or Orders, which they ought to own, receive or obey, though they may pretend they ſee it not their Duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this be the meaning of the word <hi>Church-Government,</hi> in the ſenſe of our Oppoſers, as we have cauſe to believe it is, not only from <hi>R. B's</hi> Book of Government; but alſo from what hath been ſaid or propagated by others, which we are Perſwaded will appear to all impartial Readers, who ſhall diligently, and in an unprejudiced Spirit, weigh the Second part of the ſaid firſt Manuſcript; mentioned in the Preface (which as we ſaid before is ready for the peruſal of any Friend deſiring ſo to do, though for the reaſon, mentioned in the Preface not herewith publiſht) we then directly anſwer, we are not for ſuch a <hi>Church-Government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Subject, whereof we are now treating, being as ſome may (comparatively) ſay, the very Hinge on which the preſent Controverſy ſeems to depend, we think it neceſſary to quote thoſe Scriptures from whence (ſo far as ever we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) the moſt pertinent Arguments might be produced to prove <hi>Church-Government,</hi> or a <hi>Government</hi> in ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or Members over the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. We find Chriſt thus ſaying, <hi>Moreover, if thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go tell him his Fault; if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two; and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church; but if
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57559:67"/>he neglect to hear the Church let him be unto thee as an heathen man. Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind in Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven.</hi> Comparing this Scripture touching the Treſpaſs of one Brother againſt another, with what <hi>Paul</hi> Writes, 1 Cor. 2.4. <hi>Dare any of you, having a matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another go to Law before the unjuſt, do ye not know that the Saints ſhall Judge the World? if then ye have Judgment of things pertaining to this Life, ſet them to Judge who are leaſt eſteemed in the Church;</hi> we reaſonably conclude, that the words of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtle only hinted at, either <hi>Perſonal Offences,</hi> or Differences touching <hi>Worldly Matters;</hi> and that therein the Duty of the <hi>Church</hi> was only to exhort to ſubmit to their Counſel; which If they did not, they might Juſtly be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Heathen Men:</hi> but this is nothing to the purpoſe of thoſe who have approved a Plea for ſuch a <hi>Church-Government,</hi> as <hi>Claimes a Power of Deciding Matters relating to Conſcience, and outward things alſo,</hi> on the occaſion of Differences raiſed touching Worldly Eſtate: and that others ought to obey ſuch Deciſions, which in its natural Conſequence hath (as we take it) no Leſs Tendency, than to claim <hi>Power</hi> over our <hi>Properties,</hi> as well as <hi>Conſciences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are now ſenſible that many Friends who have not been acquainted with the <hi>ſecret Cauſe of all the Differences amongſt Friends,</hi> will be even ſtartled at this, and be ready to query, <hi>Are there any ſuch amongſt the People called Quakers?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We Anſwer; Yes Verily; and that thoſe, who may be accounted <hi>Chriſtians</hi> too, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe who approved in the Second Dayes Meeting at <hi>London</hi> the before-cited Book of <hi>R. B.</hi> relating to <hi>Government in the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſhall begin firſt with the <hi>Matter of Conſcience,</hi> the Title of the ſixth Section thereof runs thus, <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>How far this</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>doth extend in matters Spiritual, and purely Conſcientious</hi> [and then treating thereon the Author thus ſaith] <hi>in which the great Queſtion is, How far in ſuch Caſes the Church may give Poſitive Orders,</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <hi>or Rules;</hi> [and ſo proceeds to ask this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57559:68"/>viz.] <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>Whether the Church of Chriſt have Power in any Caſes, that are Matters of Conſcience, to give a Poſitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or Deciſion, which may be Obligatory upon Believers?</hi>
                        </q> [and then goes on thus anſwering, <hi>viz.</hi>] <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>I anſwer affirmatively; She hath;</hi>
                        </q> [which being compared with what he writes Page 68. of his ſaid Book on this wiſe, <hi>viz.</hi>] <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>that their</hi> De facto, <hi>giving a Poſitive Sentence in ſuch Caſes, will not import Tyranny, and Uſurpation; neither will the pretences of any contradicting them, or refuſing to ſubmit on the account</hi> they ſee it not,</q> 
                        <hi>excuſe them of being guilty of Diſobeying God;</hi> clearly ſhewes to us his meaning to be <hi>That in ſome Caſes the Conſciences of Believers ought to be bound by the Poſitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of</hi> Others, <hi>without leaving any Liberty for a Believer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſubmit, on account of</hi> not ſeeing it his Duty to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
                     <p>This Meaning and <hi>Government</hi> over the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> we take to be contrary to the Principle of Truth, and Liberty we have in Chriſt Jeſus; for that no <hi>Outward Sentence</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> whatſoever can obliege the Conſcience to <hi>be approving this or that Exerciſe or Practice;</hi> or to be in the <hi>Belief</hi> of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that Judgment, Sentence</hi> or <hi>Decree,</hi> until ſuch time that the Conſcience (thorough the inſhining of Chriſt's Light therein) comes to be ſatisfied, and thereby to be bound and obleiged; and though we find the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. ſaying on this wiſe, <hi>Remember them which have the Rule over you;</hi> yet he doth not ſay, Such who had the <hi>Rule,</hi> were the <hi>Church;</hi> but diſcribes them in the next following words to be ſuch, <hi>who had Spoken unto them the Word of God;</hi> ſo that if any Authority be given to any to <hi>Rule,</hi> as Members of <hi>Chriſt's Body,</hi> it appears from the Scriptures of Truth to be unto ſuch, <hi>who had Spoken the Word of God unto them,</hi> over whom they had the <hi>Rule;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be no Preſident or Proof that <hi>mixt,</hi> and <hi>uncertain Aſſemblies,</hi> as to Number and Qualification may call themſelvs the <hi>Church,</hi> and under that Notion give forth <hi>Orders, Rules</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57559:68"/>and <hi>Sentences;</hi> telling the reſt of thoſe, whom they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their Fellow-Members, <hi>'Tis your Duty to Obey, though you pretend YOU SEE IT NOT.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, it doth not appear, that thoſe who ſpoke the Word of God, did give forth any Sentence by vertue of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that might become a Bond on the Conſcience, before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God; and Why? Becauſe it is by that <hi>Grace</hi> that the heart comes to be Eſtabliſhed, according as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> writes, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. of the ſame <hi>Chapter. For 'tis a good thing that the Heart be eſtabliſhed with Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Perhaps ſome may quote <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. Who thus ſaith, <hi>Now we Command you, Brethren, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you with-draw your ſelves from every Brother, that walketh diſorderly, and not after the Tradition which he received of us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this we ſay; <hi>Paul</hi> in the following <hi>Verſe</hi> gives the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for the Urging <hi>Obedience to his Precept,</hi> viz. <hi>For ye your ſelves know how ye ought to follow us;</hi> hence we may conclude, that their Hearts were ſo eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> as that the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of their <hi>Duty</hi> became a greater <hi>Obligation</hi> upon them, then <hi>Paul's Command.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Verſe the 14th. of the ſame Chap. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any Man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, note that Man, and have no Company with him, that he may be aſhamed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This (may ſome ſay) <hi>ſeems very poſitive to imply, that God hath given Authority to ſome to Rule in the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Anſwer to this is; <hi>Paul's</hi> words related to ſuch, of whom (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 11, 12, 13. of the ſame <hi>Chapter</hi>) he ſaith; <hi>We heard that there were ſome amongſt you that walked Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and work not at all; but are Buſy-Bodyes: therefore them that are ſuch, we Command and exhort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they work with quietneſs, and eat their own bread, and ye Brethren, be not weary in well-doing;</hi> and then he exhorts Verſ. 14th, <hi>If any man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, note that Man, and have no company with him.</hi> This clearly ſhewes what the Apoſtle had relation unto, <hi>viz.</hi> to that <hi>neceſſary</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57559:69"/>and <hi>commandable Duty</hi> mentioned in <hi>Verſ.</hi> the 11th. <hi>that ſuch who were Buſie-Bodies, walking inordinately, might not (in their buſie, inordinate Spirit) eat the Bread of others, but work, that they might eat their own Bread:</hi> were this Command of the Apoſtle obeyed by many of thoſe, who run to and fro, having little other Buſineſs or Matter, than to cry againſt ſome Friends, under the term of <hi>Dark, Seperate Spirits</hi> (though ſuch as are <hi>Faithful</hi>) we ſhould not have ſo many <hi>Falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers as we have, troubling the Countries, raiſing publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in Meetings for worſhip amongst us,</hi> to the open <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of Truth</hi> and <hi>Obſervation of our common Enemies,</hi> whereby they rejoyce and cry, ha! Several inſtances of this nature are recorded in the Second part of the ſaid firſt Manuſcript mentioned in the Preface ready for the View of Friends, as aforeſaid. And though they give the firſt onſet by <hi>Publick Teſtimonies</hi> againſt <hi>particular Perſons</hi> (Ancient and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Truth) yet a ſober Requeſt from any of us, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to know the <hi>Matter that's Evil</hi> whereof ſuch are guilty, is with them ſufficient ground to lay the Contention at our Doors; ſaying, <hi>Why cannot you bear? all things would have been well, if you could have born;</hi> But alas! we are not of thoſe who can ſo ſuffer <hi>Truth to fall in our Streets;</hi> and ſo they go on where they have Credit, proſeliting ſimple People againſt honeſt Friends, by their <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Slanders.</hi> But to return, let us conſider, <hi>Whether the laſt recited Quotation ſpeaks any thing to encourage one Brother to claim Authorty over the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of another; or that ſome Members of the Church of Chriſt, may meet together, and give forth Sentences and Decrees in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to Conſcience againſt others, oblieging all to ſubmit thereto.</hi> Nay verily, that Conſtruction cannot ſtand in Truth and Righteouſneſs, though it ſhould come from an Aſſembly called a <hi>General Aſſembly:</hi> For albeit the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells them, <hi>They were come to the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Church of the Firſt-Born, which are written in Heaven;</hi> Yet he ſpeaks nothing of their Authority, as Judges (much leſs that their Sentences, or Judgements ſhould obliege the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57559:69"/>Conſciences of others, without relation to a Conviction from the Appearance of the Spirit of Truth, or Grace of God in themſelves) but tells them, that <hi>God is the Judge of all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing we are to manifeſt is, that ſome there are amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> (who may be accounted Chieftains too) that approve of a Plea for <hi>Government</hi> amongſt themſelves, which in its natural conſequence hath (as we take it) no leſs tendency than to <hi>claim a Power over our Properties, as well as Conſciences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Proof whereof we ſay, the <hi>Second Days Meeting</hi> of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Friends in <hi>London</hi> took upon them the Approbation of the aforeſaid <hi>Book,</hi> relating to <hi>Government,</hi> whereby they are Entituled to the Matter therein contained.</p>

                     <p>This we Teſtifie is repugnant to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus within us, and Teſtimony of the Scriptures of Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us; for as Chriſt's Kingdom is not of this World, ſo 'tis not likely that his Members ſhould by his Authority, claim a Juriſdiction in the Matters relating to this World: and if Chriſt himſelf, when he was deſired by a certain man,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps ſome may query of us, <hi>What ought to be done in Caſes of Difference, between Brother and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we ſay, The Parties differing ought to chooſe <hi>Honeſt Men skilled</hi> in the <hi>matters</hi> wherein they <hi>differ,</hi> to end the ſame, and not go to Law; and if any ſhall refuſe ſo to do, the Church of Chriſt have only Power to <hi>Admoniſh</hi> them to their <hi>Duty;</hi> and if they <hi>refuſe</hi> to take their wholſome Counſel, may then declare ſuch unworthy of their Society; but for any Members under the notion of the <hi>Church,</hi> to ſay, <hi>We have Power to decide and remove theſe things, without the aſſent of the Parties differing, is an Uſurpation;</hi> and that the aſſent of Parties, was not intended by the Approvers of the ſaid <hi>Book of Government,</hi> it is evident to us; for that there is not in any part of the ſaid Book one Tittle to that purpoſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could ſuch Aſſent be ſo expreſt, and yet the Caſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57559:70"/>unto it related be pertinent to the matter of <hi>Power</hi> treated on in that <hi>Section</hi> (which was, <hi>In what Caſes, and how far this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment extends</hi>) whenas any Heathen Man might claim the like Power, when given by aſſent of Parties: And to us 'tis evident, that the Purport of <hi>Paul's</hi> Counſel to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.) at variance, was, That they who were at Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould chooſe ſome of the leaſt in the Church; and not the reſt of the Church chooſe, or ſet apart any for them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide their Differences. For that, when he ſaid, <hi>I ſpeak to your ſhame, is it ſo, that there is not a Wiſe Man amongſt you?</hi> He could not in Truth intend ſhame to thoſe in the Church, who were not at Variance, but in Peace, Love, and Unity in the Truth, each towards other; for no queſtion but they were ready to chooſe Wiſe Men to judge the matter, if they had had Power, or the differing Parties would have aſſented; but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſhame intended by the Apoſtle related to the Parties differing, who had Power to chooſe Perſons to decide their Differences, and yet would not but go to Law.</p>
                     <p>On the whole matter we have this further to Add.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> lookt on himſelf, as one having Power to command, to rule and govern over the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> and that 'twas their Duty to Obey him, whether they ſaw it ſo or no, what's the meaning that the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies for himſelf, and other his Brethren, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. <hi>That they had not handled the Word of God deceitfully, but by Manifeſtation of the Truth, commending themſelves to every Mans Conſcience in the Sight of God:</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this with what <hi>Paul</hi> writes in the ſame Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Having Hope, when your Faith is increaſed, that we ſhall be enlarged by you, according to our Rule abundantly;</hi> it appears evidently to us, that preaching up Obedience to that wherein the Conſcience through Faith is not ſatisfied, is a handling the Word of God deceitfully: and therefore, though we have been Informed, that we are <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> even by ſuch who tell us they do ſee; publickly; Preaching on this wiſe, <hi>If you do not ſee your ſelves, you muſt then follow us that do
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57559:71"/>ſee;</hi> yet we cannot on that foot embrace ſuch Doctrine, leſt like blind men we fall all together into the Ditch, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that for the light of the <hi>Sun</hi> which is no other than the dark Body of the —<hi>MOON.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are now ſenſible another Objection may thus ariſe.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>The Spirit of God (which is but one in all) hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in our Brethren to give forth certain Orders, Commands and Preſcriptions, and therefore we ought accordingly to Obey; and this cannot be called the Dictates of Fallible Man, but of the Spirit given forth through Man; and waſt thou (that pretendeſt thou ſeeſt it not thy Duty to Obey) but Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to thy own Meaſure, thou wouldeſt then ſee it ſo, and be one with the Brethren; and therefore we cannot but tell thee, 'tis thy Duty to Obey, ſince the Reaſon thou ſeeſt it not thy Duty, is thy want of Diligence, and not waiting on thy own Meaſure: beſides, we find that that very Perſon who hath travelled much for the ſettling of Mens Meetings, hath lately given forth a Paper, the import whereof is to Juſtifie</hi> Preſcriptions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we ſay, That if the Spirit of God moves in any Member of the Body of Chriſt, to give forth certain Orders, and Preſcriptions, with reſpect to the reſt of the Members, as that which (though relating to their Conſciences) they ought to perform and practiſe, whether they ſee it their Duty or no, or whether they are free ſo to do or no; then (no doubt but) they ought ſo to act, and do, becauſe the Spirit of Truth hath ſo moved: but this is to ſuppoſe, that which under the Diſpenſation of the <hi>Second Covenant,</hi> we have not the leaſt ground from the Scriptures of Truth, or Light of Chriſt to ſuppoſe: For if the Blind was not to be accepted of for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice under the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> much leſs can it be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under the <hi>Second:</hi> And therefore we do not believe, that we ought to expect that any ſuch motion from the Spirit of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57559:71"/>God ſhould appear through any one, or more Members of the Body of Chriſt, with reſpect to other Members of the ſame Body: and our Faith is, that <hi>all thoſe who are Heirs of that Kingdom which is everlaſting, are entituled to a like Freedom, not to be Impoſed upon each by other, contrary to the Divine ſenſe and Heavenly Underſtanding, which as Co-heires and Co-workers together they are made Partakers of:</hi> And this in the enſuing diſcourſe will evincingly be manifeſted from the Scriptures of Truth; however we muſt confeſs, he that is not diligent to wait upon God in the Exerciſe of his own Meaſure of Grace received, is by the Light of Chriſt condemnable; not for refuſing to perform that which he ſees not to be his Duty, with reſpect to other mens Lines made ready to his hand, wherein he is not ſatisfied; but for his neglecting to wait upon God, becauſe 'tis manifeſt in every one, that hath been convinced of the Truth, that 'tis our Duty to wait upon God. And this our ſenſe and reaſon anſwers to the Teſtimony of the Scriptures of Truth, where 'tis ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all Ungodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men, who hold the Truth in Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them:</hi> So 'tis clear to us from the Scriptures of Truth without us, as well as from the Light of Chriſt within us, that the Wrath and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God goes forth againſt ſuch, as Live not Anſwerable to what God hath manifeſted in them; but 'tis neither agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Scriptures of Truth, or Light within; for any to poure forth Judgments, againſt any, for not following or giving heed unto this, or 'tother Preſcription, or Outward Obſervation, wherein the Conſcience is concerned, when ſuch are not convinced thereof to be their Duty, from the manifeſtation of Gods Spirit in them.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be conſidered is this, that in all the laſt mentioned <hi>Objection,</hi> there is no Plea for Obedience unto, or following any thing but the Spirit in its Appearance, whether
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57559:72"/>through the Brethren, or thy ſelf. From whence we obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no certain Deſcription, who are meant by the word <hi>Brethren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That 'tis the Appearance of the Spirit that we ought to follow.</p>
                     <p>Now ſhould this Queſtion be ask't of ſuch, who may ſo Object, as aforeſaid, <hi>Would you have us follow we know not what?</hi> we are ready to Believe, that they would ſay, <hi>Nay,</hi> if they anſwered any thing to the Queſtion; and if ſo, then the <hi>Force</hi> of the <hi>Objection</hi> falls; for that we account it our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to follow the Appearance of the Spirit of God, through the meaneſt Member, when our Conſciences are convinced that 'tis the Appearance of that Spirit. But before we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay in Truth, though we ſhould do as ſuch an one would have us, that we are Followers of, and led by the Spirit of God, no more than Jeſus can in Truth be called Lord,
<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</note> and not by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we cannot on this occaſion but teſtifie, that as that Obedience which is of Faith in Chriſt finds Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with the Lord;
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.</note> ſo that <hi>Obedience</hi> which is not of <hi>Faith,</hi> being <hi>Sin,</hi> is but a <hi>dead Performance,</hi> and not the <hi>Fruit of a living Member,</hi> who through the Obedience of Faith unto Righteouſneſs is made alive unto God. And therefore it cannot be the Duty of any Member of Chriſt's Body, to run before his Inward Guide, but to wait upon the Lord, that all his Actions may be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to the Manifeſtation and Revelation of the Spirit of God in himſelf; which ſeems clearly agreeable to the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle, where he thus ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you; nevertheleſs, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that ſavours the things of God, may eaſily perceive, that the meaning of the Spirit through <hi>Paul</hi> unto thoſe <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians was, that thoſe who were come to a ſtate of Perfection,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57559:72"/>ſhould walk by that Rule, whereunto they had attained; but thoſe, who had not attained ſo far, and were otherwiſe-minded, were to wait for the Revelation of the Son</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now to conclude, as to this <hi>Objection,</hi> we have this further to add; that we do know many of our Oppoſers, or at leaſt ſuch, who are not at Unity with us, have very confidently made uſe of ſuch Diſcourſe as is contained in the laſt recited Objection, to induce us to follow outward Preſcriptions and Orders, though not convinced of its ſervice: which occaſions us to be Jealous, that in proceſs of time, the enemy may ſo enter in at this Door, as that Darkneſs may more generally overſhadow again, than it yet doth; though our Hope in God is, that he will lay ſuch a conſtraint on many of thoſe, whoſe Eyes are open, beholding the approached Apoſtacy, as that they may be raiſed in a ſenſe of Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and appear as Lyons on the behalf of the <hi>Lyon of the Tribe of Juda;</hi> to oppoſe every appearance of that Spirit which would be exalting <hi>Self,</hi> or any <hi>Form, Obſervation, Preſcription,</hi> or <hi>Order,</hi> to be as a Bond on the Members of Chriſts Body, when by the Light of Chriſt (their alone Lawgiver) they are not fully perſwaded thereof in their own Conſciences, which (undoubtedly) was the meaning of the Spirit through <hi>Paul,</hi> when he writ unto the <hi>Romans, Chap.</hi> 14. Verſ. 5, 23. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind; For whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to come a little cloſer to the matter in hand, 'tis too too evident, that <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to <hi>Outward Preſcriptions</hi> is taken as <hi>a mark of Apoſtacy,</hi> even amongſt thoſe who have Been under the profeſſion of Truth, of which many inſtances, too too Large here to inſert, might be produced, which is now forborn, becauſe we ſuppoſe there are very few amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> (for whoſe ſakes this is chiefly written) who are ignorant of the Truth hereof.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it hath been an Obſervation of late, that theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Queſtions, to the like import, have been frequently
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57559:73"/>askt, by ſuch with whom we cannot be at Unity in all things, viz.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Are you for Womens Meetings?</hi> Meaning diſtinct Womens Meetings from Men, amongſt whom Under Pretence of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of the Poor, another thing ſeems to be more chiefly aimed at, as anon will be made appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Are you for Recording Condemnations?</hi> Meaning thereby, whether the Partyes, who have Condemned their Failings (and through the Mercies of the Lord have been reſtored, and their Officence blotted out and forgiven by him) aſſent thereto or no.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Are you for ſettled Monethly and Quarterly Meetings touching Outward Buſineſs, ſince thoſe who would have Meetings as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offers are accounted Deſigners to through down all Meetings for Outward Buſineſs, relating to the Affairs of Truth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when theſe, or ſuch like Queſtions have been a skt of Friends in Truth, that could not Anſwer thereto <hi>[Yea]</hi> we are ſenſible that it hath been taken by many as a ſufficient token of <hi>a Dark, Leavened, Rending, Dividing Spirit;</hi> and meerly (as we take it) form an apprehenſion that the <hi>Form</hi> they ſtand for, is thereby ſtruck at (though the Services would be effectually performed in another method, as experience in the Counties of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> and <hi>Wilts</hi> hath of late teſtified) for were it not ſo, that great ſtreſs is laid upon the Outward Form of things preſcribed to be practiſed, how comes it to paſs, that <hi>J.

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Much more might be collected from the <hi>Articles</hi> (being forty four in number) exhibited by <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57559:73"/>ſix Perſons as aforeſaid, to ſhew how earneſtly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly the very <hi>Outward Form</hi> of things are contended for; which occaſions us (in all ſeriouſneſs of Spirit) thus to ſay, May the Lord God of Heaven and Earth ſo preſerve his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they may not be enſnared by thoſe who have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo great Contention about the <hi>Outward Forms</hi> of things preſcribed to be practiſed amongſt the Profeſſors of Truth, leſt they with them prove to be <hi>Boaſters, proud Blaſphemers, falſe Accuſers, Deſpiſers of thoſe that are Good;</hi> which are the very Marks and Tokens of thoſe who had a <hi>Form</hi> of Godlineſs, but denied the <hi>Power</hi> thereof, from whom the Apoſtle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to turn away; and how far theſe Marks reſt upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe, who ſo earneſtly contend for their <hi>Outward Forms,</hi> we leave to the Impartial Reader with the Light of Chriſt to Judge, when he hath thorowly informed himſelf of their Fruits.</p>
                     <p>Oh Friends! the ſerious Conſideration of theſe things bows us before the Lord, and in a Senſe of his Mercies to us we can no longer keep ſilent, but in his Fear declare that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are concerned for the Cauſe of God, and his Truth: and ſince it is ſo, that an ill uſe is made of that Spirit of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and Condeſcenſion, which we are ſenſible hath been uſed by many of our Brethren, it is now become our Portion to unburthen our ſelves, of that which hath been our Burthen; believing that the Lord is not only ariſen, but will yet more and more ariſe, againſt that Spirit that would exalt it ſelf, over the Heritage of God, endeavouring to rule over their Conſciences, whenas Chriſt alone is Lord thereof.</p>
                     <p>It may now be worthy our Obſervation to conſider, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Encouragement was given by our Lord, and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus (whileſt on Earth) unto his Diſciples to become Rulers one over another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find that he Exhorts his Diſciples, <hi>Judge not, that ye be not Judged: be not ye called</hi> Rabbi, <hi>for, one is your Maſter, even
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57559:74"/>Chriſt. And all ye are Brethren: but he that is greateſt amongſt you, ſhall be your Servant; and whoſoever ſhall exalthimſelf, ſhall be abaſed; and he that ſhall humble himſelf, ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is no ground to believe that Chriſt Intended, that when he was departed, his Diſciples ſhould be exalting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one over another, as <hi>Governours,</hi> and <hi>Rulers:</hi> and if we conſult the Scriptures of Truth, we ſhall find; that though his Diſciples had a Dependency upon him, whileſt in his Bodily Appearance to be their Leader; yet he tells them (<hi>John</hi> 16.7.13.) <hi>It is expedient for you, that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, I will ſend him unto you, and he will guide you into all Truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had it been ſo, that Chriſt Jeſus intended the Exaltation of one of his Diſciples as an <hi>Head,</hi> or <hi>Supream</hi> (unto whom the reſt ought to have had an Eye, in a more peculier manner than ordinary) he would have undoubtedly ſignifyed ſo much; but doubtleſs he ſaw that their Eye and Dependency was too much on his <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Bodily Appearance:</hi> and therefore ſignifyed, <hi>'Tis Expedient I go hence, that the comforter come;</hi> agreeable to which are the meaning of the Apoſtles Words, <hi>though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet henceforth know we him no more,</hi> that is to ſay, after the fleſh no more.</p>
                     <p>All which doth clearly demonſtrate unto us, its not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, that under this Adminiſtration, <hi>we ſhould have our Eyes out unto Man;</hi> but that our great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency ſhould be <hi>on that Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, which Chriſt Teſtifyed the Father would ſend in his Name, to teach us all things, and that this Comforter ſhould be in us.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on this occaſion 'tis with us to give this further Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that every Member of the Body of Chriſt, is thorough the Death of Chriſt, made dead unto any other Law, ſave the Law of the Spirit of Life, manifeſted thorough the ariſing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57559:74"/>of Chriſt, by his appearance in every ſuch Member; and ſo as perticuler Members are become maryed unto him, and having all Fellowſhip each with other in the Spirit, thoſe who are ſuch, ought to demean themſelves each towards other <hi>full of Love, Charity Bowels of Compaſſion, Longſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forbearance, Meekneſs, Humility, Patience, Gentleneſs,</hi> and of all other <hi>vertues,</hi> that are the Fruit of the Spirit of God; but as to <hi>Obedience,</hi> every Member owes that unto <hi>Chriſt, his Head, unto whom every thought</hi> (according to the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ought to be brought into obedience.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> to the General Meeting; <hi>and their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> To <hi>Womens Meetings; and their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Firſt, we ſay, many there are amongſt us, who Affirm, that they have more than ordinary cauſe to believe, that many Profeſſing the Truth do look upon <hi>G. F.</hi> as one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57559:75"/>whom the Lord in theſe latter dayes hath raiſed up, and ſet in the like Place amongſt the <hi>Children of Light,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Children of Iſrael;</hi> and that whoſoever ſhall <hi>Oppoſe</hi> him, <hi>ſhall never proſper; which</hi> (we are perſwaded) hath ſo over-awed many, that they become Sacrificers of their own Senſe and Underſtandings to the Will of Man; and doubtleſs on this Foot, many may think, thoſe who told him his <hi>Book</hi> about <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi> is <hi>Notoriouſly Erronious,</hi> will never proſper, though they have evidenced it to be ſo to his Face, and that in the view of ſeveral Hundreds of Friends at a Meeting aſſented to by himſelf, and thoſe of Party with him, when at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in the 12th. Moneth, 1677. As one inſtance of the Errours of the ſaid Book take this, Pag. 43. he thus ſaith, <hi>And was not</hi> Micah's <hi>Mother a Virtuous Woman? Read Judges</hi> 17. <hi>and ſee what ſhe ſaid to her Son;</hi> and a few Lines after he ſaith, <hi>So theſe and ſuch Women are recorded for their Wiſdom, and their Virtue, and their Faith.</hi> For our parts, we cannot underſtand, that any thing of <hi>Wiſdom, Virtue</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> is recorded touching <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chah's Mother,</hi> unleſs <hi>Bleſſing or Curſing</hi> out of one Mouth from an <hi>Idolatrous Woman</hi> may be accounted the Fruit thereof. Many other things might be quoted out of his ſaid Book no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly Erronious, and therefore will certainly remain on Record to his ſhame, until he repent. And 'tis not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelited Parties ſaying, <hi>None ſhall Proſper that Oppoſe him;</hi> nor yet his ſaying, <hi>That he knew what he did, and ſaw it would be a Stumbling-Block</hi> (for ſo <hi>William Rogers</hi> poſitively affirms he did ſay to him) will excuſe him in the Day of the Lord: for we firmly believe that unleſs he repent, he will become <hi>Deſpiſed</hi> and <hi>Vile</hi> before the People, even as the Lord made thoſe Prieſts in the time of the Law, who (as the Prophet ſaid) <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>cauſed many to ſtumble,</hi> to be therefore <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,</hi> and <hi>vile</hi> before all the People, we know he hath been an Inſtrument to cauſe many to <hi>Condemn their Failings,</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57559:75"/>that he may be ſo Ingenious as once to <hi>Confeſs his own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are perſwaded, ſome others have lookt upon the <hi>General Meeting</hi> as that unto which they ought to have an Eye, being principled to receive, own and ſtand by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes from thence, as the <hi>Oracles of God;</hi> without bringing the Matter they appear at Unity with, to the Teſt of Chriſt's Light in their own Conſciences: and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if ſuch as are principled to ſhut out <hi>Reaſon, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Jealouſie</hi> without Diſtinction, thus do.</p>
                     <p>And when any Papers are given forth by that Meeting or <hi>G. F.</hi> ſuch as are at Unity with them bring them to the <hi>Mens Meetings</hi> for Outward Buſineſs, which oft times occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention;</hi> the one party accounting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oblieged (as we take it) to receive and ſtand by what comes from them; the other Party do the ſame alſo, when it reaches to the Witneſs of God in their Conſciences, as Matter proper to be brought to ſuch Meetings, but if not, they cannot receive it, though an Angel from Heaven bring it; then the other Party accounts this the Fruit of a <hi>Jealous, Dark, Leavened Spirit,</hi> and thus Contention and Debate hath ariſen, even amongſt thoſe, who formerly (before the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form</hi> of Government was ſo much pleaded for) walked together in Peace and Concord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is amongſt many Friends, a Difference touching the <hi>Meetings of Women ſeperate from the Men,</hi> which though not hitherto treated on, yet it may not be improper to be ſpoken to on this Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>But firſt, we think it neceſſary to anſwer this Queſtion, which naturally ſeems to ariſe for the Information of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>viz. How came thoſe Meetings firſt to be held, and for what end?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this we anſwer, that <hi>G. F.</hi> ſo far as we underſtood, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted thereto, and the End thereof (in ſum) was <hi>to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57559:76"/>take care of the poor</hi> in ſome caſes, the Meeters themſelves according to their Freedom,
<note n="*" place="margin">Note, <hi>This</hi> Method <hi>of raiſing</hi> Monies <hi>for that</hi> Service, <hi>was though very unreaſonable, becauſe it reached not all, by whom the</hi> Charge <hi>of the</hi> outwardly poor Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>of the</hi> Church of Chriſt, <hi>ought to be born.</hi>
                        </note> raiſing Mony, which cauſed the Charge to light much on ſome, who were moſt conſtant in Meeting, whileſt others, for want of another Method to collect Monies, were very little concerned in the <hi>Charge of the Poor.</hi> But in proceſs of time, ſome Friends thought it neceſſary, that <hi>Marriages</hi> might be propoſed to the <hi>Womens Meetings;</hi> but yet ſeveral Friends in divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes would not aſſent, that the <hi>Diſtinct Meetings of Wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> ſhould be concerned in <hi>Marriages;</hi> at length ſeveral of thoſe, who had appeared for thoſe <hi>Diſtinct Meetings</hi> to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaid
<note n="*" place="margin">Note, <hi>It appears in a</hi> reply <hi>Written againſt</hi> John Story's <hi>and</hi> John Wilkinſon's Anſwers to <hi>the</hi> 44 Articles.</note> 
                        <hi>this is that which</hi> G. F. <hi>Exhorted to in the Beginning, and Bleſſed be the Lord the Faithfull ſee a Neceſſity, and Cauſe to propoſe the Marraiges to the Faithful Men and Womens Meetings; and whether their ſight is not Dark, that ſee not the Neceſſity of propoſing their Marriages to the Faithful Men and Women in their Diſtinct Meetings.</hi> This being uttered by thoſe of party which <hi>G. F.</hi> (as we take them) was thought very ſtrange, for that as divers Friends of <hi>Briſtol</hi> have teſtifie <hi>G. F.</hi> propoſed not his Marraiges to the <hi>Womens Diſtinct Meeting</hi> in <hi>Briſtol</hi> (where his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was accompliſhed) though ſuch a Meeting was held there many years before. Beſides, in a Paper of Direction given forth by <hi>Gorege Fox,</hi> he Directs, <hi>that the mens Meeting may be acquainted with Marraiges,</hi> and ſaith nothing of propoſing them to the <hi>Womens Diſtinct Meetings;</hi> which clearly ſhews, that thoſe who writ the aforeſaid Anſwer and <hi>G. F.</hi> ſeem not at Unity therein.</p>
                     <p>But this (as we ſuppoſe) not being known to many, ſome were very urgent to impoſe that Practice on Friends, or elſe to render ſuch as Oppoſed <hi>Dark Spirits,</hi> which occaſioned many Friends to be Jealous that a <hi>Submiſion</hi>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:57559:76"/>was not only intended to <hi>Meetings of Men,</hi> but <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> alſo, and therefore Friends, who in ſimplicity aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the latter Meetings, as ſuppoſing Women inſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fitter to pry into the <hi>Neceſſities of the Poor,</hi> than <hi>Men</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering alſo what weak People have frequented <hi>Mens Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>) did at length begin to be Jealous, that the words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 3.12. were again fulfilled in our Age, <hi>As for my People, Children are their Oppreſſors, and Women rule over them. Oh my Poeple! they which lead thee, cauſe thee to Err.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Jealouſie encreaſing, many of thoſe, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that <hi>Women</hi> ſhould hold their <hi>Meetings</hi> apart from the <hi>Men,</hi> to take care of the <hi>Poor</hi> in ſome Caſes, became leſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to ſuch Meetings, leſt inſtead of being Servants to the <hi>Poor</hi> for the Truths Sake, and taking the weight and Burthen of that Care from the Men, they ſhould become <hi>Rulers over both Men and Women;</hi> and that which ſeemed to confirm the Reaſonableneſs of the ſaid Jealouſy was this:</p>
                     <p>It hath been obſerved, that though <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> were aſſented to, to <hi>take care of the Poor</hi> in ſome Caſes. as the chief, if not the only end thereof, yet there is ſo little ſaid concerning that End in a Book relating to <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> given forth by <hi>G. F.</hi> that 'tis now a Queſtion with many, whether that be not one of the leaſt Services intended at this day thereby; becauſe we do not find, but that all ſpoken in Relation thereto in the whole Book, conſiſting of ninety ſix Pages in Octavo, might be comprehended in leſs than half a ſide of the ſaid Book; and the drift and ſcope of the Book ſeems to be chiefly for Proof of <hi>Womens Offering Sacrifices, Preaching, Teaching, Inſtructing, Exhorting, Admoniſhing, Propheſying, Governing, Judging, Singing Dancing, Playing upon Muſick, and that</hi> Micahs <hi>Mother, an Idolotrous Woman, ſpoken of Judges</hi> 17. <hi>was a virtuous one; and that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Women did continue among the</hi> Jews, <hi>til they went into
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57559:77"/>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> but for Proof quotes only 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. where we find nothing ſpoken of any Aſſemblies <hi>of Women,</hi> ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe <hi>Women</hi> who in the Houſes of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> (which good King <hi>Joſiah</hi> broke down) <hi>wove Hangings for the Groves, which the ſame King cauſed to be burnt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, as to this third Particular, we have this further to ſay; ſo it is, that many Jarrs and Jangles have ariſen touching <hi>Meetings of Women,</hi> and the End and Service thereof: ſome think them uſeful in Cityes, where many <hi>Poor</hi> are, and the <hi>Women Meeters near</hi> together; but yet divers of the ſame Perſons think them uſeleſs in the Countries, where few <hi>Poor</hi> are, and the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men live Far aſſunder:</hi> and for ought we know, ſome obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill conſequence, that hath attended them in divers Places, may think it had been better they had never been held amongſt us. For our parts, on the whole matter, we ſay, 'tis a Shame for a Man to become an Inſtrument that <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> ſhould be held, (Chiefly if not only) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of <hi>ſerving, and relieving the Poor</hi> in ſome caſes, more effectual then before, and yet Publiſh a Book under pretence of <hi>incouraging</hi> the ſaid <hi>Meetings,</hi> whence it is thereby apparent, that ſome other <hi>End</hi> is now at leaſt, if not from the Beginning, aimed at, than was manifeſted plainly in the Beginning.</p>
                     <p>This, in ſhort, ſeems not like plain dealing, and the Fruit thereof is manifeſt to be Evil: for many who have been as Pillars in thoſe Meetings to this Day, have been reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>Diſcouragers</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Meetings,</hi> not becauſe their Perſons and Purſes are wanting therein; but rather becauſe they cannot be at Unity with ſuch <hi>airy Imaginations,</hi> which ſome (who (as they may take it) ſeem <hi>Affectors of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Lovers of Preheminence</hi>) do bring forth; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, they are entred into the <hi>Poſſeſſion of the Power of God,</hi> becauſe they take upon them to be Members of a <hi>Womans Meeting, diſtinct from the Men:</hi> thoſe who on that foot ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57559:77"/>conclude, we cannot but take to be Ignorant of the <hi>Power of God,</hi> notwithſtanding they may quote <hi>G. F.</hi> for Proof of ſuch their Reaſon, who writing to <hi>Thomas Goldney,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>that he was moved to ſet up Womens Meetings, that all might be in the Poſſeſſion of the Power of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That now which is upon our Spirits to recommend unto all in the Love of our God, as the only Expedient for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Breaches, in a few words, is this, Let every one lay down their Crowns at the Feet of Jeſus our Lord, and thoſe who have ſtriven for <hi>Outward Rules, Government,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence</hi> over their Brethren, when the Lord hath not called them thereto, ſay in their Hearts, <hi>Let the time paſt be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and for time to come let us ſtudy Peace, as Servants to one Lord and Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt, the Righteous one, who by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhining Light is become our Lawgiver;</hi> that ſo the antient Love towards all our Brethren in the Truth, may be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, and renewed each towards other, to the Conſolation of one anothers Souls in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far proceeded, to manifeſt a part of thoſe things touching which the <hi>Faithfull were at Unity,</hi> and the <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>Meanes</hi> whereby <hi>that Unity was Broken;</hi> we think meet now to cite an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> perfixt to the <hi>Hiſtorical Manuſcript,</hi> made mention of in the Preface to this Treatiſe, being a Proper Teſtimony on this occaſion, for and <hi>on the behalf</hi> of the <hi>Truth;</hi> for that therein is plainly demonſtrated the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of ſuch, as Sathan hath made uſe of, to rend and divide the Church of Chriſt.</hi>

                           <p>THe great Evidence of pure and undefiled Religion, is a <hi>Conſcience void of Offence towards God;</hi> but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is attended with <hi>Anxiety</hi> and <hi>Trouble.</hi> He that in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus inclines to preſerve ſuch a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> muſt not ſo value his <hi>Repute</hi> and <hi>Name</hi> amongſt men, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to looſe his Peace with the Lord. The conſideration whereof hath abundantly ſatisfied us, to encourage the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> knowing, that the Long-ſuffering, Patience and Warnings of many Faithful Friends have had little place with many ſuch perſecuting Oppoſers of the Friends of Truth, as are under the Profeſſion thereof. And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57559:78"/>therefore it may be Juſt with the Lord to ſuffer their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering to have an End.</p>
                           <p>We alſo know, that the Unſavoury Teſtimonies and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian-like Diſcourſes of many ſuch in our Meetings for the Worſhip of God, have been ſo frequently (as well as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly) manifeſted, as that 'tis thereby known both to Profeſſors and Prophane, that the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> are now Divided: by which 'tis to be doubted, that ſome may really conclude, that though their <hi>Name</hi> is not extinguiſh't, yet that the <hi>Nature, Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which accompanied them at their firſt coming forth, hath of late ſuffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.

                           <p>That now the <hi>Reader</hi> may have ſome ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what the Lord hath manifeſted unto us on this Occaſion, we further thus Declare:</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Original Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Diviſion</hi> and <hi>Seperation</hi> between the Members of any Society, once at Unity in the Truth, touching Religious Matters, hath ſprung from <hi>Satan.</hi> The <hi>Perſons</hi> in whom he hath chiefly appeared to accompliſh the ſame, have been ſuch as uſually appear more <hi>publick</hi> than other their Brethren, and that under various Qualifications: <hi>ſome have had Zeal without Knowledge, and ſome have had Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without Zeal, and others have abounded in Confidence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57559:79"/>either Knowledge or Zeal:</hi> and none of theſe, whilſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed under theſe Qualifications, have found Acceptance with the Lord</p>
                           <p>And as <hi>Satan</hi> hath made uſe of Perſons thus variouſly Qualified, for the Preſervation of his Kingdom; ſo <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (whoſe Appearance hath been and is to deſtroy the Works of the Devil) hath and doth make uſe of ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Hand, whom he hath furniſhed with <hi>true Zeal,</hi> and that according to <hi>Knowledge:</hi> for though all have not the like Degree of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> yet that <hi>Zeal,</hi> which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed according to the Meaſure of Knowledge given by God, and received by Man, finds Acceptance with the Lord of Life.</p>
                           <p>Now foraſmuch as in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> variety of Matters is Diſcourſt, wherein Divers Perſons have been concerned (many of whom were once at Unity (which we are perſwaded conſiſted in the Everlaſting Truth) and that every one of them might reaſonably have been taken to be under one of the aforeſaid Qualifications, 'tis with us at this time (conſidering that the Tree is to be known by its Fruit) to note a few things attending ſuch reſpective Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and that Chiefly for the ſakes of ſuch, as have <hi>Zeal without Knowledge:</hi> and ſo, if the Lord make us Inſtruments in his Hand to open the underſtanding of any, whereby they may come to have a true Savour of (and Unity with) thoſe who have ſo received the Spirit, as to be exerciſing themſelves <hi>in true Zeal, and that according to Knowledge,</hi> we then ſhall have our End.</p>
                           <p>We now begin to ſpeak of thoſe who have <hi>Zeal</hi> without <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Charity obliegeth us not to conclude, that they deſign any thing more than to Live well, that ſo they may dye well, or any thing leſs, than to appear what they know they are: not but yet this we certainly know, that albeit theſe have profeſſed <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> to be their <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> yet many of them (for want of <hi>Knowledge</hi>) have been

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57559:80"/>Day) to Walk by, (neglecting to commit and Commend every one unto the Word nigh in the heart, that thereby they may be preſerved from ſubjection to any thing outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained, which they may either ſcruple in Conſcience, or are not led by the Word nigh in the Heart to Practiſe) are ſuch as in the beſt and moſt Fovourable Conſtruction, act from <hi>Zeale without Knowledge,</hi> in which kind of Zeal <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6.) though as to the Righteouſneſs of the Law blameleſs, yet) Perſecuted the Church.</p>
                           <p>This kind of Zeal is accompanied with that <hi>Ignorance</hi> which the chief amongſt Apoſtatized Churches have accounted <hi>the Mother of Devotion,</hi> by which Thouſands in Ages paſt (in the Dark Night of Apoſtacy) have been led into the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of many Unſavoury Dictates, Erroneous Decrees, Unwarrantable Traditions, and Superſtitious Examples, either of one Man, or aſſemblies of men, not knowing what they have either believed, or Practiſed, to be an incumbent duty upon them, through an inward evidence from Gods Witneſs in their Conſciences) or Tryal thereof by the Light of Chriſt.

                           <p>Moreover, 'tis obſervable, that (if Report be true) this doctrine hath of late been exalted, <hi>NO UNITY BUT IN CONFORMITY;</hi> which if applyed to the <hi>Outward Preſcriptions of one Man,</hi> or <hi>Aſſemblies of men, aſſuming to themſelves authority to act and determin in matters appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Goſpel, and its Order, thereby to become a Bond upon the Conſciences of thoſe, who have Believed in the Everlaſting Light of Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (as the great Order and Ordinance of God in this Goſpel Day) may occaſion the Continuation of <hi>Diſcord Diſtraction</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> contrary to the Goſpel and Doctrine of Truth, which hath been publiſht, received, and believed amongſt the Children of Light in theſe latter days, who neither have nor can receive any Doctrine, contrary to

                           <p>We now appeal unto every underſtanding, ingenious and impartial Reader, whether ſince the Labour of the Apoſtles of Chriſt in the primitive dayes, was to draw the <hi>Outward Jew</hi> off from the obſervation of theſe <hi>ordinances,</hi> which were realy eſtabliſhed by the appointment of God himſelf, having exalted inſtead thereof the <hi>word nigh in the heart, and Law written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> as a fulfilling of that which (according to the Word of the Lord by the mouth of his Prophet) was to come to paſs under the new Covenant, which was not to be like unto the Old, can conſiſt with the tenour of the new Covenant for any to attempt the eſtabliſhment, or giving forth of <hi>Outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Preſcriptions, Sentences or Decrees</hi> to be (on that foot) a Bond upon the Conſciences of thoſe, who have believed in the Everlaſting Light?

                           <p>And now, as to thoſe <hi>who have Knowledge without Zeal,</hi> Charity doth not Oblige us to conclude, that ſuch in that ſtate chiefly deſign to live well, that ſo they may dye well: for (as Chriſt ſaid, ſo may we) <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Unto whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Much is given, of him ſhall be Much required:</hi> the want of <hi>Zeal</hi> in a known <hi>Good Cauſe</hi> is (as we take it) the <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> of a Known <hi>Incumbent Duty,</hi> wherein God hath given Power, elſe, how could it have been ſaid to the Luke-Warm, Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (after an underſtanding was given unto her, how ſhe might come to ſee, <hi>viz.</hi> by anointing her eyes with Eye Salve, <hi>Lev.</hi> 3.19 <hi>(be Zealous &amp; amend?</hi> for doubtleſs Power was given of God into her to amend as well as direction

                           </p>
                           <p>But this is far wide of that <hi>Zeal,</hi> which accompanyed the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Converted State, who was termed a

                              <hi>Ringleader of the Sect of the Nazerenes</hi> by the Unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> that would have Judged him according to their Law (which undoubtedly would then have inflicted <hi>Severe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> on him) which being duly conſidered, we may well ſay, 'tis far wide of <hi>Pauls Zeal</hi> to <hi>fear</hi> (under this Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) the Title of a <hi>Sect-Maſter,</hi> on the ſcore of <hi>refuſing Outward Conformity to Outward Rules and Orders,</hi> relating to the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> under the Notion of <hi>Goſpel-Orders, eſtabliſht amongſt the People called Quakers;</hi> not only Becauſe they have <hi>no Law</hi> whereby corporally to Puniſh, but alſo becauſe we have no Ground either from the Word of the Lord by the Mouthes of his Prophets, or from the Appearance of Chriſt by his Light in us, or from the Scriptures of Truth, given forth by inſpiration, ſince the appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh, to Expect, <hi>that any ſhould be Inveſted with Power from on high, to Eſtabliſh ſuch things relating to the Conſcience;</hi> much leſs to Expect, <hi>that the Children of Light (under the New Covenant) ſhould be led by the Eternal Spirit and Word nigh in the Heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a conformity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Moreover, 'tis Obſervable, <hi>Pauls</hi> Plain confeſſion thus was, <hi>After the Way which they call</hi> Hereſy, <hi>ſo Worſhip I the God of my Fathers, Believing all things which are Written in the</hi> Law, <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And herein do I Exerciſe my ſelf, to have always a Conſcience <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oid of offence towards God and towards Men.</hi>

                           <p>If all thoſe, unto whom God hath given the Knowledge of his Truth in this Goſpel-day, had had ſo much <hi>Zeal,</hi> as to have walk't according to this example, they might have all become <hi>Honourable</hi> in their day, &amp; have <hi>kept a Conſcience Void of offence towards God and towards men:</hi> and then none of them would have been afraid of being Stigmatized as <hi>Sect-Maſters,</hi> by ſuch, who (Like the Outward Jew) have Gloryed in things Outwardly Pretended to be <hi>Eſtabliſhed</hi> (in this Goſpel-day) and have made ſuch things to be as a <hi>Rule,</hi> whereby they have indeavoured to try their Brethren (who at this day have approved themſelves <hi>Jews in Spirit, Zealouſly exerciſing

                           </p>
                           <p>In the Next Place, we come to take a little notice of thoſe, <hi>who abound in Confidence, without either Knowledge or Zeal;</hi> this ſort may be well compared unto thoſe <hi>Beaſts,</hi> with whom ('tis reputed) <hi>Paul</hi> Fought at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which (if it were ſo) was (doubtleſs) a conteſt had with <hi>Unreaſonable Men.</hi> The bait by which this ſort are enticed to appear Some-Body in probability is this, <hi>The Door is open for any under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Truth</hi> (whoſe Lives are not Outwardly Scandalous) <hi>to appear</hi> (amongſt ſome of the Society of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) <hi>as Governours;</hi> and though 'tis hard for us to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who amongſt ſuch are the <hi>Perſons</hi> that are to be <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> when Liberty is taken and admitted, as aforeſaid (whereby none of the ſociety is excluded) to appear as <hi>Governours,</hi> yet ſo it is; and of this have our Eyes, and Eares been Witneſſes: A Part of the Doctrine of this ſort we have underſtood to be on this wiſe, <hi>If you do not ſee your ſelves, you muſt follow us that do ſee:</hi> Alaſs!

The Lord hath had a regard to his own Name, and to the Glory of his Eternal Power, ſo that though many ancient and honourable Brethren, whom the Lord Commiſſioned in theſe latter Days, to publiſh his Everlaſting Goſpel (Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting all, <hi>to yield Obedience unto the Appearance of Chriſt by his Light in them</hi>) are fallen aſleep; yet there are many of the ſame Stock yet remaining, upon whom he hath not only poured forth of his Spirit, and Anointed them to publiſh his Everlaſting Goſpel, but alſo hath kept them in Integrity, and their Garments undefiled from the Spots and Polutions of this World; and not only ſo, but hath given unto them <hi>True Zeal,</hi> according to <hi>Knowledge,</hi> thorough which the Way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God (in the Demonſtration of his Spirit) hath been declared, and hath continued them in the Service whereunto they have been called; and theſe have not, in a <hi>Temporizing Spirit</hi> (for fear of the <hi>Threats</hi> and <hi>Frowns</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>) changed their Way, nor yet followed any for the <hi>Loaves:</hi> and though ſome of theſe have of late been accounted <hi>dark Spirits, leavened Spirits, Troublers of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Sect-maſters, Leaders into a Seperation, and into down-right Independencies, Pariſhes and Schiſms;</hi> yet this Teſtimony lives with us, that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Eternal God (on which alone we are perſwaded their Dependencies have been, and are) hath accompanied ſuch, when thus <hi>Judged, Deſpiſed and Reviled,</hi> by that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who (unto us appear) as if their <hi>Dependencies were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men, that labour and travel to gather unto themſelves.</hi>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57559:83"/>ſtill, and Fear not;</hi> and I was ſo; for he made me ſo, as if I had not been in the Body: and preſently I ſaw a great Field or Common, where many Beaſts were Feeding, amongſt which were a great Flock of Sheep feeding alſo, and I beheld them, and that there were very many goodly Sheep, and ſo me alſo were very weak and Scabby; but they did all feed together, and did not hurt one the other, neither did they deſpiſe one the other at all; at laſt the <hi>Night</hi> was near, and I ſaw the Shepherd come to gather the Flock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fold (which I ſaw there by) and ſtaid by the Fold himſelf, and ſent his Dogs, and he had many pretty little Dogs, which did eat of his own Morſels, and did lie at his Feet; for he loved them very well, and took great Delight in them, and he did make them gather his Flock, and they did go round the Flock: but ſome of the Sheep were feeding about, and ſome did feed by the way, and did not go ſo faſt as the reſt; and when the Dogs ſaw that, <hi>Some of them, that were young, and not well Acquainted with the Maſters Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Cuſtome, did run from the Flock with Fierceneſs after the Sheep, that ſtayed behind, and did affrighten the Sheep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away;</hi> for the Sheep did not underſtand that the Dogs would have had them to the reſt of the Flock, but were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Dogs: and ſtill <hi>the Dogs did purſue them Sheep, and did bite ſome of them;</hi> and when they were weary with running after them, then they returned again to the Flock, <hi>and did in their Minds greatly blame the Sheep:</hi> but I ſaw ſome of the Dogs, <hi>that were well acquainted with their Maſters Manner of gathering his Flock, did wiſely go behind the Sheep, and ſuch did drive them gently along, without hunting of them, or wearying of themſelves:</hi> ſo when they had gathered the Flock together, the <hi>Shepherd</hi> put them into the Fold; but there were many Goats amongſt them, which did puſh with their Horns againſt the Sheep, and did put many of them by the Door, ſo that they did run by the ſide of the Fold; but the <hi>Shepherd</hi> did gather them together again,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57559:84"/>and when he had gathered them all together into the Fold, he made faſt the Door, and went to ſeek the <hi>Sheep,</hi> which did not come with the Flock; but while he was looking for them, the <hi>Goats</hi> were very troubleſome in the Fold, and hurt the Sheep very much; but he would not ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them until he had the other alſo; and when he had found them, ſome of them were lying very lame, <hi>for the Dogs had hurt and wearied them,</hi> and ſome of them were feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under green Hedges, but the Shepherd took the Sheep that were lame, and carried them on his Back, and did drive the other before him, and did bring them to the reſt of the Flock; but the <hi>Sheep</hi> that were lame, he put into a little place alone, and did dreſs their Wounds, and Anointed their Feet with an oyl, that he had, that did perfectly cure all their Diſeaſes; for he ſpared no pains, but was willing to hurt himſelf, rather than them: for his Ointment was mixed with his own Blood, and did by ſympathy Cure all their Diſeaſes, and when he had cured them, he put them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did put the <hi>Goats</hi> from amongſt them, and then did they reſt in perfect Peace; for there was nothing to make them afraid amongſt them; but they did all feed Innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, and his care was over them all alike, according as they had need: And he took their Fleeces as every one had, for ſome had much better than other ſome; but thoſe which had the <hi>great white ſoft Fleeces, did not deſpiſe them which had little courſe ones:</hi> for they were both profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him; and I ſaw ſome of the Sheep which had almoſt no Wool at all on them, and them neither did he deſpiſe, for the Bryers and Thorns had pulled it from them, <hi>when the unlearned Dogs did drive them away from the Fold;</hi> but when the Winter came, he took of the wool of the other, and put it on them, and the other Sheep were not at all diſpleaſed at it, neither was there any Envy in their Hearts: and I ſaw the <hi>Shepherd</hi> himſelf take ſome of his own Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57559:84"/>and covered them, that were very naked, ſo that they were all preſerved from the cold of the Winter, and the Froſt had no Power over them. But I looked when the <hi>Shepherd</hi> would have beaten the Dogs, or have killed them, but he did not hurt them at all, only put them in a String, and led them with him; for he purpoſed to inſtruct them better; <hi>but ſome of them would not be led, for they were very fooliſh, and did not underſtand his Mind;</hi> but them he took home, and would have kept them at home, <hi>but they would not ſtay, but would always be going abroad, and barking at the Lambs to affrighten them out of their Paſtures: and ſome of the Dogs were ready to devour them, for there was ſomething of the Nature of the</hi> Wolf <hi>in them;</hi> and them he bound up in Chains to ſulfil his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on them.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57559:85"/>own Praiſe in my Mouth, and receive of his own from me;</hi> for I was nothing before him, who is all Praiſe, all Love, all Life, all Beauty, all Holineſs, and of his Compaſſion there is no end, what ſhall I ſay of him! if I had the Tongue of Men and Angels, it could not ſufficiently ſpeak forth his Praiſe; and when I ſaw how exceedingly all Men were to praiſe him, or to ſpeak of his Wonders (for they were altogether paſt finding out) then I wept greatly, and deſired only, that he would permit me to ſit at his Feet, and he ſwore unto me by himſelf, <hi>That he would deliver me from all my Troubles within &amp; without;</hi> and truly, it was his own free Promiſe, for I durſt not ask it of him, but was contented to have waited ſtill in my <hi>Sorrowfull Condition</hi> all the Days of my Life, that I had to ſpend amongſt Men.

                              <p>"Friends, I am conſtrained by the Spirit of Endleſs Love to warn you all, <hi>that you may forbear Judging of any Man any more, upon any Pretence whatſoever, but commit all Judgement to the Son;</hi> for he cryeth in me, <hi>that he will ſhortly appear with righteous Judgment upon the Earth, and Wo was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that hath took upon him to ſit upon my ſeat of Judgment, and hath not Judged Righteouſly; for the ſame Meaſure that he meeteth, ſhall be met to him again, for whoſoever I find upon my ſeat of Judgment when I come, if he be not as I am (Holy, Juſt and Mercifull, without any mixture) him will I deſtroy with the Breath of my Mouth, for he is as unclean Smoak before me.</hi>

                              <p>"Therefore, Dear Friends, let all <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> be far from you; for thus ſaith the Voice in me, <hi>Whoſoever I find in Envy, the ſame Envy ſhall be his Torment, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in Covetouſneſs, or in Pride, or any unclean Mind, that ſame ſhall be their Cloathing, and they ſhall ſtand behind me, and all that is with me, having no other Garment but their own

                     <p>Though many things are very worthy notice from the above-cited lines, given forth through the Servant of the Lord <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> and obvious enough to many; yet for the ſakes of ſome, 'tis thought meet to take notice of two particular Matters, which ſeem very pertinent on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That ſome of the young unlearned Dogs, not well acquainted with the Maſters Manner in gathering the Sheep, did run from the Flock with fierceneſs after the Sheep that ſtaid behind, and did affrighten them, and bite ſome of them; neither would they be led, nor yet ſtay at home, but would always be going abroad, and barking at the Lambs to affrighten them, being ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57559:86"/>them; for there was ſomething of the Nature of the Wolf in them; and them the Shepherd bound up in Chains to fulfil his purpoſe on them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That ſome of the Dogs, well acquainted with the Maſters Manner, did wiſely goe behind the Sheep, and ſuch did drive them gently along, without hunting of them, or wearying themſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From theſe two Citations out of the aforeſaid Paper we may learn, that the Spirit of the Lord, thorough his Servant, hath in a Parable very lively deſcribed a part of what hath happened amongſt the Flock of God in theſe latter Days; for of certain knowledge we can ſay, that there are ſuch as are learned in the School of Chriſt, who (being well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Chriſt Jeſus their Lord and Maſters Manner of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Sheep) do not over-drive the Flock, nor yet wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves for meer Vanity; and there are alſo the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,</hi> who are not acquainted with the great Maſters Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in gathering the <hi>Sheep,</hi> and theſe in a great Meaſure have occaſioned the Encreaſe and Continuation of <hi>Diviſion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by their fierce contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an <hi>outward Unity</hi> and <hi>Conformity,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Forms of Government</hi> in the Church; ſo that they ſeem not only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bite, but alſo to devour others, that <hi>ſee not clearneſs in themſelves to practiſe</hi> according as they, in their <hi>hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit</hi> would (as much as in them lies) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain</hi> and <hi>inforce.</hi> Nay, there are ſome, not only unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Chriſt Jeſus's Manner of gathering the <hi>Flock</hi> (like a Shepherd <hi>that gathers his Lambs in his Armes, and gently leadeth them that are with Young</hi>) but alſo have laid blame on ſuch as have exactly Walked in his Footſteps. And indeed, ſo Fooliſh and Confident have ſome been, that the maſters manner of gathering the Flock hath become as a <hi>By-Word</hi> or a <hi>Mock,</hi> and not only, ſo but Matter of <hi>Evil Fact</hi> in the ſenſe of ſome, <hi>Witneſs the Forty Four Articles</hi> Relating to <hi>Church-Government,</hi> drawn up againſt <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> two
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57559:86"/>
                        <hi>Ancient and Honourable Friends in the Truth,</hi> a part whereof is for that they ſhould ſay, <hi>THEY WOULD NOT HAVE FRIENDS O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ER-DRIVEN.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To Conclude; We alſo know, that ſome of theſe have been by the Spirit of Truth Reproved, <hi>as not fit to ſay they, ſpeak in the Name of the Lord, When the Lord hath not ſpoken by them; nor yet to appear as if they were ſent of God, to gather the Flock, or to Proclaim themſelves Keepers of other Folks, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyards, when they have not kept their own Vineyard:</hi> by which it appears, that the will of the Lord, touching ſuch, hath been, <hi>that they ſhould Hearken unto the Word of Reproof, and be led by his Spirit;</hi> which if they had, they would have ſtay'd at home, until they had been Inſtructed and Learn'd in the School of Chriſt; but yet notwithſtanding, ſome have, contrary hereunto, gone abroad, and their great Work hath been, to cry out againſt <hi>Honeſt Friends,</hi> under the notion of <hi>Dark Spirits, levened Spirits, Troublers of Iſrael, Corah's, Judaſes, &amp;c.</hi> juſt like unto thoſe <hi>Young Unlearned Dogs</hi> ſignified in the <hi>Parable,</hi> that <hi>would not be led;</hi> but <hi>would be going abroad, and Barking at the Lambs, to affrighten them, being ready to devour them;</hi> for as in the <hi>Parable</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>there hath been ſomething of the Nature of the Wolf in them;</hi> But Bleſſed be the Lord, many are Witneſſes, that of late ſome of them have been as in <hi>Chains</hi> and <hi>Fetters of Iron,</hi> ſo that they are not able to Prey upon thoſe who are upon the Rock Chriſt, who doubtleſs, in his own time, will fulfil his Purpoſe on them. Oh! that all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd herein at this Day would ſeriouſly Conſider, &amp; Proceed no farther in their <hi>Hunting, Biting, Devouring Spirit,</hi> nor yet <hi>Weary themſelves for meer Vanity,</hi> leſt the Eternal Decree of God ſhould be ſealed againſt them, to their Deſtruction for ever more.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this firſt part, we have yet to add, that ſince 'tis ſignified, that the <hi>forty four Articles,</hi> before cited, relate to <hi>Church-Government,</hi> and that we ſay, they were drawn up againſt two <hi>Antient and Honourable Friends</hi> in the Truth,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57559:87"/>viz. <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> we think it proper to cite one Paſſage as an evidence thereof, out of the 4th. Section of the <hi>Second</hi> part of the <hi>Hiſtoricall Manuſcript,</hi> Mentioned in the <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi> with the omiſſion onely of the <hi>Names of Perſons,</hi> for the Reaſons already given in the ſaid <hi>Preface.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Paſſage is as Followeth.</p>
                     <p>Before we ſhall make any Obſervation on the aforeſaid Articles or Preamble thereto, 'tis needfull to Inform the Reader, that nine Perſons, Concerned in Exhibiting the ſaid <hi>Forty Four Articles</hi> againſt the two Friends, ſpoken of before, thus Declare concerning them, in a Letter to nine others Choſen by the Accuſers to be Judges over them, viz.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>And Friends, it is not any Perſonall Treſpaſs againſt any of us, that we Charge them with, nor any Particular Concern of our own, as Men, that we are in the</hi> Defence, <hi>but the Cauſe of Almighty God, and in the ſenſe of the Wrong they have done to him;</hi>

                     <p>Moreover, 'tis evident to us, that ſome have had ſo great
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57559:87"/>eſteem for the <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> or <hi>Papers</hi> given forth by him, as that they have concluded it to be no leſs than the Fruit of <hi>Confuſion and Darkneſs to Believe, that what he hath given forth, was not intended by him to be urged with Severity,</hi> which is no other than an inforcing, and this doth thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John Story</hi> (One of thoſe two Brethren) Articled againſt as aforeſaid, in their Anſwer to the ſaid <hi>Forty Four Articles,</hi> took occaſion to give his ſenſe touching ſuch things, which <hi>George Fox</hi> had given forth on this wiſe, viz. <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>That he did not Believe that George Fox intended any ſuch thing, that they</hi> (Meaning his <hi>Papers</hi> Directed to the <hi>Churches</hi>) <hi>ſhould with Severity be urged upon any of Gods Faithfull People, but as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or Directions, Commended them to the Churches, Leaving the Effect thereof to God, and his Leading Grace in his People, to make uſe thereof as he ſhould manifeſt a need of ſuch Direction, Counſel or Advice.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>To this ſenſe <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> and eight Perſons (Part of thoſe, who were Concerned in Exhibiting the ſaid <hi>Forty Four Articles</hi>) Replied, a part whereof was on this wiſe: <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>Truly thy Darkneſs and Blindneſs is eaſy to be felt, and they muſt be very dim of Sight that ſee thee not: oh! the confuſion thy Dark Spirit is in.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>To this we ſay, This Anſwer ſeems ſo very <hi>Dark,</hi> as if <hi>Blindneſs</hi> were the Lot of their Inheritance, who ſo writ: <hi>forwe</hi> well remember, that the Teſtimonies of our ancient bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who were skil'd in gathering, and carefull not to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flock) did not encourage any to follow any <hi>Outward Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi> whatſoever, without an inward Conviction (from the Leadings of Gods All-ſufficient Grace, Freely given to Profit withall) of the needfulneſs of the Direction, Counſel or Advice contain'd therein: and <hi>Why?</hi> But Becauſe an <hi>Obſervance</hi> (not grounded on their Sufficiency of Gods Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace in our ſelves) <hi>of Outward Inſtructions</hi> or <hi>Directions,</hi> in this Goſpel Day, may find no more Acceptance with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57559:88"/>the Lord of Life (who is now to be worſhiped, obeyed, and reverenced, not otherwiſe than in and by the Spirit and Light, thorough which he doth appear in Man) than an offering of the <hi>Halt</hi> and the <hi>Blind</hi> (which was forbidden in the time of the Law) for a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> might: and this our ſenſe may well be vindicated from ſuch like Teſtimonies as theſe, frequently utter'd by our antient Brethren; <hi>[We Preach not our ſelves; Let not your dependency be on us; we are not (neither deſire to be) Lords over your Conſciences; you ought to Be lieve for your ſelves and ſee for your ſelves; and therefore we Counſel you to draw Water out of your own wells; let it be your own, and not anothers</hi> We now appeal to Gods Witneſs in all Conſciences, how this Kind of Language and Diſcourſe can agree with ſuch as render it the <hi>Fruit of Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Outward Inſtructions or Directions of G.

Had the ſenſe of thoſe, whoſe ſenſe we cannot own, been only with relation to the Unfaithfull, it might have ſeem'd a little better.</p>
                     <p>The Conſideration of theſe things is great cauſe of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and mourning; eſpecially when we Conſider, that we have no Ground to believe, either from the Scriptures of Truth given forth by Inſpiration, or from the Light of Chriſt in our Conſciences, that any man (according to the motion of Gods Spirit in this Goſpel-Day) ought to take upon him the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth any Outward Rules, or Preſcriptions relating to Faith or Diſcipline in the Church, with an intent that they ſhould become a Bond upon others to ſubmit thereto, further than from a recommendation unto the Conſcience a ſervice may be ſeen therein, according to the meaſure of Light given from him, who is the fullneſs: but whether this our ſenſe is not by many others (beſides the aforeſaid nine Perſons)
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57559:88"/>amongſt the People called Quakers ſlightly eſteemed, and a combined ſort of Submiſſion (contrived, as we ſuppoſe, by a few, though) entered into by many at this Day, we ſhall leave it to the unprejudiced underſtanding Reader to Judge, on mature Conſideration of what yet Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                     <p>Some few yeares paſt many Friends in the County of <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> having been a long time burthened in monethly and quarterly Meetings by ſuch as endeavoured to introduce the practice of ſome things (under the Notion of Church-Government) which they could not (as they have declared) in Conſcience conſent unto, did at length forbear to joyn with ſuch on the Dayes of monethly and quarterly Meetings, which were underſtood by us to be firſt aſſented to (we cannot ſay, unalterably eſtabliſht) to relieve the Poor and take care of any other outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern relating to the affaires of Friends, as a Society gathered into the Everlaſting Truth, Abhorring Lord-ſhip over one anothers Faiths or Conſciences. But yet the Perſons ſo refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to joyn with others, as aforefaid, did (as we have been credibly informed) on convenient Times and Days, appoint by themſelves, to meet together, to take care (in that method wherein they found Freedom in the Truth) of the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for which <hi>Monethly</hi> and <hi>Quarterly Meetings</hi> were firſt Underſtood to be appointed.</p>
                     <p>This by the other Party was called <hi>a Seperate Meeting,</hi> and the Meeters accounted <hi>Dark, Leaven'd, Rending, Dividing, Seperate Spirits;</hi> ſo that at length a Paper was given forth, and ſubſcribed by <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> and <hi>Sixteen</hi> Perſons more, Belonging to Nine Meetings for Worſhip of God, wherein they thus declare. <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>And we being ſenſible of the great trouble and diſſatisfaction in the Church of Chriſt throughout this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concerning this ſaid Seperation, we do therefore with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and at our ſeveral Meetings reſpectively ſignifie our Abſolute
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57559:89"/>diſlike thereof; and we do hereby, in the fear of the Lord, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all thoſe concerned in the ſaid Seperate Meetings in our Affaires, as they ſtand in the Seperation; and we do declare, that as ſuch a Meeting, they have no Right to act in the Church Affaires, in the Capacity they are in; but we do hereby ſignify, our Abſolute Refuſal to Submit any of our Affaires either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Poor, or otherwiſe, to the Ordering of the ſaid Seperate Meetings; but do ſubmit them to our Eſtabliſht Monethly and Quarterly Meetings aforeſaid, for</hi> Weſtmore-Land, <hi>ſo far as our affaires are concerned therein, to be Ordered as in the Wiſdom of God and Unity of his Spirit they ſhall ſee meet.</hi>

                     <p>From theſe fore-going Lines we obſerve, That though the Giver-forth thereof do not poſitively ſay, that the ſubmiſſion of ones Affairs (without reſtriction to Temporal or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Affaires) to the Eſtabliſht Monethly or Quarterly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhall for the future be an Outward Mark to know a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church by, or at leaſt to diſtinguiſh ſuch as are not Members of the Church; yet who can but reaſonably ſuppoſe, that ſuch a Meaning is their Meaning, or at leaſt the Meaning of him or them chiefly concern'd in drawing up the ſaid Paper, and promoting Subſcriptions thereto, ſince 'tis Plain (from the very Words cited) that others concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Seperate Meetings</hi> (who have declared that for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake they cannot Submit to them) have no Right to act in the Churches Affaires; and not onely ſo, but that they take themſelves to be inveſted with Authority (as to us appeares) by uſing the Word <hi>[Diſcharge]</hi> for no one can <hi>Diſcharge</hi> another in any caſe, without <hi>Power</hi> ſo to do. And if we do but conſider that the <hi>taking care of the Poor</hi> is one part of the Churches Affaires, from which thoſe of the <hi>Seperate Meeting</hi> are Diſcharged, or declared to have no right to act in it, ſeemes to us extreamly <hi>Unchriſtian-like;</hi> for if it were ſo, that they had been overtaken in a fault, that can be no ſufficient ground to declare, that they have no right to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57559:89"/>adminiſter their Charity to the Poor Members of the Church, becauſe the taking care of ſuch is Commendable in any Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of People whatſoever.

                     <p>But notwithſtanding all this, we dare not ſay, that his Preaching the Light in the beginning of his Travels abroad, as well as the Preaching the Light by others his Fellow-Servants in the Beginning with him) was not the Miniſtration given them of God; for at the ſound thereof many Faces gathered Paleneſs; Horror and Amazement ſeized many, who then became ſenſible of their <hi>Loſt State</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> whileſt they were admiring their <hi>Teachers,</hi> and buſied in <hi>Outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> more than in the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt:</hi> And that Day (wherein many were not only ſo ſtrucken with Amazement, but through Faith received the Teſtimony given, touching the Light of Chriſt) might truly be termed <hi>The Day of their Infancy in the Truth,</hi> and ſo the more likely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon by the Enemy, who in that Day (as in Ages paſt) ſought how he might deſtroy that Tenderneſs to the Truth, which was ſo begotten: for 'tis certainly known, that many (whoſe Eyes ought to have been unto the <hi>Creator,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring and giving Glory unto him, for his Gifts of Grace, and Miniſtration of Light then revealed) did on a ſudden admire the <hi>Creature</hi> in ſuch an abundant manner, as if not only the <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>watering</hi> were by him, but the <hi>Encreaſe</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57559:95"/>and Practices, whereon little or no occaſion is taken to treat in the Firſt Part, it is at this time upon us to add a farther Teſtimony to the Ancient Truth, according as the Lord in his tender Mercy hath, through the Appearance of his Son Chriſt, by his Light (or Manifeſtation of his Grace) and Teſtimony of his Faithful Servants in the Scriptures of truth, opened; wherein our intent is not to treat large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on every Subject, becauſe the enſuing Diſcourſe is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to manifeſt, <hi>What a remnant ſtand for, who</hi> (being faithful unto their firſt principle) <hi>cannot in a temporizing ſpirit change their way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Deſires and Breathings of our Souls unto God are, that every Reader may be ſerious and unprejudiced in the peruſal of this our Teſtimony, and then we do not doubt but 'twill be reaching unto the Conſciences of ſuch, as that which is not inconſiſting with the Teſtimonies given forth by Inſpiration (recorded in the Scriptures of Truth) and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, or Appearance of Chriſt by his Light (which is that by which the Lord doth ſee, and is ſeen in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) wherewith every man coming into the world is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for that the Lord by his ſpirit hath opened, that there is not any other way, by which all things relating unto the Kingdom of God, and Salvation of mankind comes to be revealed, and this appears agrecable to the Scriptures of truth, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>
                     <p>We are now ſenſible, that ſome, who may peruſe the foregoing Scriptures, may be ready thus to ſay, <hi>You ſeem to propound two ways by which the things appertaining to the Kingdom of God, and Salvation of Mankind have been, and are revealed,</hi> viz. <hi>the Spirit of Truth, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt by his Light, as One Way; and the Scriptures of Truth as Another Way.</hi>

                        <hi>That the holy Scriptures were able to make him wiſe unto Salvation; and that they were profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs;</hi> yet 'tis ſpoken with reſpect to thoſe <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are given forth by inſpiration of God,</hi> and with this limitation, <hi>viz. thorow the ſaith that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereon we obſerve, that the Scriptures given forth by inſpiration, are but as an Inſtrument made ſerviceable to the Reader through the Spirit, whereby faith in Chriſt comes to be raiſed; even as a Man indued with the Spirit of God, may in the hand of the Lord be an Inſtrument through ſound Doctrine, and wholſom exhortation, to open the inward Eye of the Mind (which hath been darkned) and to awaken the Conſcience (which hath been defiled;) that ſo man may come to be renewed in the ſpirit of his Mind unto God, through faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Conſcience purified from Dead Works through the blood of the Covenant, to ſerve the Lord in Truth, and Righteouſneſs; and therefore we reaſonably conclude. That there is but One way (though various in Operation and Manifeſtation) through which the Things appertaining to the Kingdom of God, and Salvation of Mankind comes to be revealed, which is by <hi>the powerful appearance of Chriſt by his ſpirit and light,</hi> convicting the Conſcience, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and renewing the Mind unto God; ſometimes through Scriptures given forth by inſpiration, ſometimes through Man as an Inſtrument, and ſometimes by the appearance of the Spirit and Light in Man, without the Aſſiſtance of ſuch Inſtruments: but yet the end of all is, <hi>that faith in Chriſt may be raiſed;</hi> wherein (as the Evidence of things not ſeen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57559:96"/>by the Carnal Eye) the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, which is <hi>that Treaſure,</hi> whereof the Apoſtle ſpoke, <hi>that is hid in our Earthen Veſſels, that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that Power might be of God, and not of man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things being duly conſidered, this Teſtimony doth naturally ariſe, that neither the Scriptures of Truth, nor any other writings whatſoever (though given forth by the Spirit of God itſelf) can properly be termed ſo profitable a Rule unto us, as the Light and Spirit from which they were given forth; and therefore the Eye of our Mind ought chiefly to be unto the Spiritual Appearance of Chriſt by his Light, and Spirit in us, as that Unerring Guide, which never can be removed into a corner.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we find the Scripture itſelf teſtifying, <hi>That no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any Private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.20.</note> that is, it ought not to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted but by the Holy Ghoſt, through whoſe Motions 'twas given forth, for all other Interpretations may truly be termed <hi>Private.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From whence we obſerve, that if the Prophecies in the Scriptures of Truth ſhould be read unto us from Morning to Evening, and from Evening to Morning again, we might receive little Benefit or Profit thereby, unleſs the Eye of our Mind come to be ſtayed in the Unchangeable Light, and Spirit of God, whereby the meaning of the ſpirit through them (out of all <hi>Private Interpretations</hi>) hath been, and is ſignified unto Man.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Doctrine was acceptable to many, who in the Love of Truth received the joyful Sound thereof; but unto others mean and deſpiſed, who notwithſtanding that Teſtimony, accounted the Scriptures of Truth, a <hi>More Sure Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> unto the <hi>Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The conſideration whereof at this time, hath been as an obligation to examine, whether the aforeſaid Doctrine (ſo acceptable to ſome, and deſpiſed by others) be conſonant to the Scriptures of Truth; which task is the more freely undertaken, becauſe the aforeſaid Doctrine hath become ſo great a ſtumbling block unto many, as that they have thought it a ſufficient evidence, that the profeſſors thereof have been out of the path of truth, readily objecting on this wiſe.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57559:97"/>
                     <p>Objection. <hi>Do you not think, that thoſe Jews who cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt, acted not from the Light Within, Since ſome of them, at leaſt, verily thought they did God good ſervice therein?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus premiſed, 'tis now needful to examine, what may be ſpoken from the Scriptures of Truth for the Light within, and to turn in the Mind unto the ſame, to obey it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In order thereunto we find <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt thus teſtifying,
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.4.9.</note> 
                        <hi>In him,</hi> (meaning the Word, which was God) <hi>was Life, and the Life was the Light of men. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. I am the Light of the World,

<note place="margin">Joh. 12.46.</note> I am come a Light into the World, that whoſoever believeth in me ſhould not abide in Darkneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Scriptures plainly ſhew, that we are to believe in, and follow Chriſt, who is that Light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Objection.</hi> However ſome objecting may ſay, <hi>What's this to a Light Within? 'tis very plain that</hi> John <hi>the Evangelist meant nothing of a Light Within, in your ſenſe, but of the Perſonal Appearance of Chriſt Without, as that Word which was made Fleſh;</hi> and, as Evidence, produce what the ſame Evangeliſt ſaith <hi>Chap.</hi> 9th, <hi>and</hi> 5th. <hi>As long as I am in the World, I am the Light of the World.</hi> And Chap. 12.35. <hi>Yet a little while is the Light with you; walk while you have the Light.</hi> And ver. the 36. <hi>While ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this may be anſwered, That theſe laſt recited Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57559:97"/>do in the moſt favourable conſtruction, on the object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors part, intimate, that Chriſt the Son of God, while he was in the World, was the Light of the World; but doth not ſay that he is, or would be <hi>no longer</hi> the light of the world: Such a ſaying, or ſenſe, would limit the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Light to that <hi>Body only,</hi> and diſpenſation of time, wherein the ſaid <hi>Body</hi> appeared on Earth, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the very words of the Evangeliſt, before quoted, <hi>viz.

                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, ſuch a limitation, as aforeſaid, would have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to make void the virtue and efficacy of the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was offered up a ſacrifice to take away the ſins of many; and on this ſcore doth the author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> teſtify,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.28.</note> 
                        <hi>that unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time, without Sin unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is a clear Evidence unto us, that the benefit of the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not witneſſed effectually in this our day, but by thoſe, who having looked for his ſecond appearance, have received him in his Appearance; this Appearance we take to be his Appearance by his light and ſpirit in the hearts of thoſe, who through <hi>faith</hi> in his <hi>blood</hi> have known their Conſciences purified from Dead Works, and ſo come to ſerve the living God in Truth and righteouſneſs,</p>
                     <p>'Tis now to be conſidered, Whether theſe words <hi>[Turn in your Minds]</hi> be agreeable to truth, for that this kind of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may be raiſed:</p>
                     <p>Objection. <hi>Doth not this put the Creature upon Action in his own Self-will, when as the Will of Man cannot bring forth that Birth unto which power is given to become the Sons of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For anſwer hereto, 'tis neceſſary to conſider, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Labourers in the Goſpel of Chriſt commended their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57559:98"/>and teſtimonies to the Conſciences of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Sight of God; and the reaſon doubtleſs was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a Capacity in Man, which (through the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Grace of God) renders Man capable to do the will of God in righteouſneſs unto life; and thoſe who are ſo acted, cannot be ſaid to be acted in the Self-will of Man. And on the contrary, the ſame Capacity (letting in Tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and joyning thereto) renders Man a ſervant of Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, and being once ſo dead in Sin, no redemption comes to be obtained, but through Chriſt, as the Apoſtle teſtifies,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.1.</note> 
                        <hi>You hath he quickned that were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſidered, 'tis evident, that through the Appearance of Chriſt, thoſe who have caſt off the Old Man, are become renewed in the Spirit of their Minds unto God, and ſo have put on the New Man, which after God is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Righteouſneſs and true holineſs: and therefore ſince there is ſuch a capacity in man, as aforeſaid, 'tis agreeable to Truth to exhort the ſons of men, to turn in their Minds unto the appearance of Chriſt by his Light, that through the Aſſiſtance thereof, the will of God may be done in their earthen veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be conſidered is, whether there is any weight in this objection, <hi>Do you not think that the</hi> Jews, <hi>who crucified Chriſt, acted not from the light within; ſince ſome of them, at leaſt, thought they did God good ſervice therein?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this may be anſwered, That the friends of Truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preached up the Light Within, but with reſpect to the Appearance of Chriſt by his Spirit, as that Light Within in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them: and ſince Chriſt cannot be divided, to act againſt himſelf; therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> did not therein act from that Light Within, unto which we have been directed. <hi>From
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57559:99"/>what then</hi> (may the objector ſay) <hi>did thoſe of them act, who verily thought they did God good ſervice therein?</hi>

<note place="margin">Acts 26.9, 11.</note> which if hearkned unto, would teach all men <hi>to do as they would be done by</hi>) in which zeal <hi>Paul</hi> verily thought in himſelf, that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus; and in that Self-thought (being exceeding mad) perſecuted the Church of God, conſented to the death of the Saints, and compelled them to Blaſpheme; but when the Lord was pleaſed to appear unto him, and to make him a Miniſter of his everlaſting Goſpel, he was ſent unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to open their eyes, <hi>that they might turn from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This eye that was to be opened, was not the Carnal Eye, that ſo thereby they might be turned from outward darkneſs to outward Light: for though <hi>Paul</hi> beheld the Light that ſhone from Heaven (which we take to be a Light viſible to his Carnal Eyes) yet he after continued three days blind, through the Glory of that Light; and then afterward the Lord appointed him to be his witneſs, and ſent him to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to open their eys, that they might turn from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God.</p>
                     <p>This Eye, that he was ſent to open, was the inward eye of the mind; and the Darkneſs ſpoken of, was that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their Hearts (and not their Outward Eyes) were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed, ſo that they could not behold the Light of the Glory of God ſhining in their Hearts, to give unto them the knowledge of the Truth.</p>

                     <p>But yet as it hath been, ſo 'tis the Faith of many, that the Lord never will raiſe any people, whom by his Spirit he will lead to publiſh ſuch a Doctrine (with reſpect to outward and viſible Societies of Men on Earth, that may be outwardly deſcribable) as needful to be believed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the building up one another in the moſt holy Faith; this Faith being not inconſiſtent with the Teſtimonies of the Scriptures of Truth, is grounded on the Evidence of the Light of Chriſt within; for that the contrary would have a plain tendency to draw the Sons and Daughters of men from the Anointing in themſelves, to the <hi>Lo here's,</hi> and the <hi>Lo there's</hi> again: For what religious aſſembly in Unity, and profeſſing themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> will ſcruple to ſay, <hi>We are the Church of Christ?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And albeit we muſt acknowledge, that that Church which is built on the rock Chriſt, cannot (whilſt abiding on the rock) be prevailed againſt; yet no Argument from hence, may rationally be brought to prove any one Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Church (whilſt on this ſide the grave) not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (through temptation) to Err, and depart from the Rock, whilſt there is an enemy ready to enter all, if they watch not.</p>

                     <p>And now as to Perfection we have this to ſay:</p>
                     <p>Though we do believe, that all the Gifts of God, and Works of Righteouſneſs, brought forth through the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Spirit, are <hi>perfect;</hi> and that in that ſenſe it may be ſaid, we are Partakers of a Meaſure of that which is <hi>Perfect;</hi> even as the Apoſtle teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Every perfect gift is from above; if any man offend not in word,
<note place="margin">Jam. 3.2.</note> the ſame is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man:</hi> Yet we do not believe, that there is any ſuch <hi>perfect eſtate</hi> attainable on this ſide the Grave, wherein it is not needful for man to watch and wait in the Light of Chriſt, that ſo he may not only be preſerved in that <hi>perfect ſtate,</hi> whereunto in meaſure he hath already attained, but alſo come to know a Growth and Encreaſe in the Encreaſes of God: For though <hi>Paul</hi> had attained unto ſuch a ſtate, as appears by theſe his words, <hi>Let us therefore,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.15.</note> as many as be perfect, be thus mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3.14.</note> Yet we find, that that very exhortation had relation unto a <hi>preſſing toward the Mark for the Price of the High calling of God in Christ Jeſus.</hi> Which denotes that there was a ſtate attainable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that ſtate of Perfection whereunto he had then attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to the firſt reaſon contained in the objection, <hi>That the Saints were ſubject to fail, and that many of them did fail;</hi> we ſay, That this doth not contradict any thing aſſerted by us; for we have declared that we do not believe, that there is any ſuch perfect ſtate attainable on this ſide the Grave, wherein it is not needful for man to watch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he may be preſerved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if through Unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs (which is a plain Neglect of what is the Duty of all true <hi>Christians,</hi> according to the words of Chriſt <hi>(what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, watch)</hi> any one comes either to fall away from that good State whereunto he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or elſe not to attain unto that State which is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; this cannot be a ſound argument to prove the matter againſt us intended by the <hi>Objection,</hi> viz. <hi>That man cannot ceaſe from ſin;</hi> no more than the not going of ſome Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to a certain Land, when 'twas their duty to go, or the returning of others from the ſame Land, after (according to their duty) through travel arrived there, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that 'tis impoſſble to go thither, and there remain to the end of our days.</p>
                     <p>To the 2d reaſon contained in the aforeſaid <hi>Objection,</hi> we ſay, 'Tis needful to diſtinguiſh what ſort of <hi>Works</hi> were excluded, as unneceſſary to accompany that Faith, through which Salvation is, and what ſort of Works were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57559:102"/>for though the Language of <hi>Paul</hi> excludes <hi>Works,</hi> yet <hi>James</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Jam. 2.20, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>That Faith without Works is dead:</hi> And no doubt but the Teſtimonies of theſe two Apoſtles have been underſtood to be repugnant and contradictory each to other; and on this Foot <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means</hi> to the Salvation of Mankind have been held forth; whenas, if the mind of the Spirit through them both were but rightly underſtood, there would then be no ſeeming Occaſion to declare their Teſtimonies <hi>contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> each to other: For the clearing therefore of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. we ſhall diſtinguiſh touching <hi>Works</hi> treated on by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James.</hi> There are two ſorts of works treated on by <hi>Paul;</hi> the one is <hi>Works of the Law,</hi> that by the one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Chriſt (as an eternal Sacrifice unto God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the law of Commandments was aboliſhed) is excluded, as unneceſſary to accompany that Faith, which is unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for otherwiſe, (though the Salvation of God through Chriſt was extended, as well to the believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> as the believing <hi>Jew;</hi> yet) the <hi>Jew</hi> might have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to glory, contrary to the Apoſtle's teſtimony, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion availeth any thing, but a New Creature.</hi> And therefore did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, <hi>That by the Works of the Law, no Fleſh ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> And ſo no doubt but the <hi>works</hi> of the law were that ſort of <hi>works</hi> which the Spirit of God, through that wiſe Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſignified, when he ſaid (and that in relation to ſuch as were once dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, but then quickned and become New Creatures) <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved, through faith,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.8, 9.</note> and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: not of works, leſt any man ſhould boast.</hi> The other ſort of works is of the Goſpel, and may properly be termed the <hi>Fruit</hi> of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57559:103"/>the <hi>obedience of Faith,</hi> which indeed was the very end wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> teſtified, <hi>That he had received his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that the myſtery kept ſecret ſince the World began, was revealed:</hi> Read Rom. chap. 1.5. and chap. 16.25, 26. and no doubt but that thoſe very <hi>works,</hi> which are the Fruit of the Obedience of Faith, were the works in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Spirit through <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo as that without them it might be juſt cauſe to queſtion, <hi>whether they were in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> and if not, then certainly not attain'd unto the New Creatures State, which is a ſtate of Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle is on this wiſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature;</hi> and not only ſo, but that the very works of the obedience of faith were ſpoken alſo with relation to thoſe (ſpoken of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 8.9.) <hi>Who by Grace were ſaved through Faith, and not by works;</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> (in the very next following verſe) thus ſaith, <hi>For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> Beſides 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that this our ſenſe is true from <hi>Paul</hi>'s very expreſs words to the <hi>Philipians, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Wherefore my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence only, but now much more in my Abſence; work out your Salvation with fear and trembling. For 'tis God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> This poſitively ſhews, that though there was an <hi>excluſion</hi> of one ſort of <hi>works,</hi> yet there was another ſort <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, elſe he would not have ſaid, <hi>Work out your Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. All which being ſeriouſly conſidered, 'tis evident that the meaning of the Spirit through <hi>Paul,</hi> was the ſame with the Mind of the Spirit through <hi>James;</hi> for that <hi>Paul</hi>'s words plainly ſignifie that God hath ordained, that thoſe who are ſaved by Grace through <hi>Faith,</hi> ſhould walk in <hi>Good Works;</hi> and that 'twas needful to work out Salvation: which doubtleſs related to the ſame ſort of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57559:103"/>
                        <hi>Works</hi> ſpoken of by the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>That Faith without works is dead.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jam. 2.20, 26.</note> Becauſe 'tis clear from the context, that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of works in no other ſenſe, than to be as an evidence of <hi>True Faith;</hi> and that 'twas as impoſſble that <hi>True Faith</hi> could be, and yet not accompanied with <hi>Works;</hi> as that a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Siſter naked and deſtitute of food, would be relieved by a bare ſaying, <hi>Be warm and filled;</hi> and ſo we may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude, that though the Apoſtle's Doctrine touching Salvation through <hi>Faith,</hi> and not of <hi>Works</hi> be true (not only with reſpect to the excluſion of <hi>Works</hi> which were legal, but others alſo acted in the will of man) yet from thence it cannot juſtly be implyed, as in the <hi>Objection,</hi> that <hi>good works may be wanting to ſuch as are ſaved, and ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted inſtead thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We now come to take notice of this Scripture mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Objection,</hi> viz.
<note place="margin">Jam. 3.2</note> 
                        <hi>That in many things we offend all.</hi> This was ſpoken by the Apoſtle in relation to a ſtate which was <hi>not free from ſin;</hi> but yet it cannot be inferred from thence, that ſuch a ſtate is not attainable; nay, the Apoſtle's following words are in ſome meaſure an evidence againſt ſuch a Conſtruction: for he thereby ſaith, <hi>If any man offend not in Word, the ſame is a Perfect Man;</hi> which was needleſly ſpoken by him, if that <hi>inoffenſive State</hi> was Not attainable; and if a Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from ſin in that caſe was attainable, why not in all others alſo?</p>
                     <p>And as to theſe words cited, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us;</hi> we ſay as before to the words of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> that this alſo was ſpoken in relation to a State which was <hi>not free from ſin;</hi> but yet it cannot be inferred from thence, that ſuch a State of Freedom is not attainable; and this ſenſe is proveable to us, from the very following words in the next verſe, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57559:104"/>juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi> But if this ſatisfie not, and that any ſhould yet object, <hi>that the Apoſtle's meaning touching the word</hi> Cleanſing, <hi>was but a cleanſing from the Guilt (and not from the Fact) of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> To that this may in truth be anſwered, that thoſe who are cleanſed from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, are ſo cleanſed by the Blood of Chriſt, and ſuch are born of God,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> and of theſe the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin; For his ſeed remaineth in him, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> Which poſitive expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in relation to ſuch a ſtate, as being born of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit of any other meaning, (though compared with other Scriptures in relation to the ſame ſtate, ſpoken of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other terms) and therefore we conclude, that theſe latter words, cited out of <hi>John,</hi> is a clear Evidence to prove the Interpretation (ſignified in the <hi>Objection</hi>) on the Apoſtle's words, unſound, <hi>viz. That the Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth only from the Guilt, and Not from the Act of ſin, ſo as to ceaſe therefrom whilſt on this ſide the Grave:</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if we conſider that one of the Qualifications that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly aſſigns to ſuch whom he declares of to be curſed Children,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.14.</note> was this, <hi>viz. that cannot ceaſe from Sin;</hi> and that alſo the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpoken of by <hi>John,</hi> on which a cleanſing from all ſin through the Blood of Chriſt comes to be witneſſed, was, <hi>a walking in the Light, even as Chriſt is in the light,</hi> (Read 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7.)

                     <p>But herein ſuch do manifeſt themſelves not knowing whereof they affirm; for that Wiſdom, Knowledge or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which we have as Creatures, is the proper Gift of God, and a part of his own Creation, and is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in its place: and it is againſt the nature of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being to deſtroy this Wiſdom, becauſe it is his own Gift, even as it is againſt his Nature to deſtroy the Lives of Men, which is his Creation;
<note place="margin">Luke 7.5.</note> for the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ſaith, <hi>The Son of man came not to deſtroy mens lives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>What then did the Apoſtle hint at, when he ſpoke of the VViſdom of the VVorld, the VViſdom of the VViſe, and the VViſdom of VVords?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this it may be ſaid,
<note place="margin">Act. 22.3.</note> That as <hi>Paul</hi> was brought up at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and taught according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner of the Law of the Fathers; ſo doubtleſs many there were, who through Education attained unto that, which <hi>Paul</hi> in his converted ſtate terms to be <hi>the VViſdom of this VVorld,</hi> &amp;c. From whence it may be concluded, that he hinted at thoſe things, which in that day were given forth by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and other Diſputers againſt that divine Appearance, whereby <hi>Paul</hi> was made a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Everlaſting Goſpel; which things, ſo given
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57559:106"/>forth, we do not take to be the natural Effects of that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Knowledge or Underſtanding, given unto them as creatures; but rather (being in the ſtate of Degeneration) as the Fruits of their Education and Acquired Parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being not ſubject unto the Appearance of Chriſt, they then became Oppoſers of the Truth. Beſides, as the word <hi>Fleſh</hi> in Scripture is ſometimes uſed not with relation to a <hi>Carnal Body,</hi> but in a Metaphorical and Myſtical ſenſe, by way of oppoſition to the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> ſo are theſe words <hi>fleſhly wiſdom</hi> uſed, not with reſpect to <hi>man as a creature,</hi> but by way of oppoſition to the <hi>Wiſdom of God,</hi> that's from above; and therefore is another thing, than that which man is endued withal, as he is a part of God's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, <hi>Solomon</hi> in his day magnified Wiſdom at a high rate (as the Scripture teſtifies, too large here to be inſerted) who in his day, did undoubtedly account it the ſign of a juſt man,
<note place="margin">Pro. 10.30.</note> and therefore ſaid. <hi>The mouth of the Juſt bringeth forth Wiſdom.</hi> The Apoſtle in his day did magnifie Wiſdom, exhorting the Saints <hi>to walk in Wiſdom.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 4.5.</note> Chriſt the Son of God teſtified,
<note place="margin">Mat. 11.19.</note> 
                        <hi>VViſdom is juſtified of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſidered, our deſires are, that thoſe who have true Wiſdom may prize it; that thoſe who lack it may imbrace the Counſel of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jam. 1.5.</note> and <hi>ask it of God, who giveth liberally;</hi> and that thoſe Fools, who deſpiſe Wiſdom, may come to have a ſenſe of what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpoke, when he thus ſaid, <hi>How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity, and fools hate knowledge? turn ye at my Reproof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sure we are, the Apoſtle's Writings encourages none to cry down Wiſdom at the rate 'tis of late, without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exclaimed againſt by ſome; but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for we find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57559:106"/>thus to ſay,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.9, 28.</note> 
                        <hi>VVe do not ceaſe to pray for you, and to deſire that you might be filled with the Knowledge of his VVill, in all VViſdom and ſpiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> and again thus, <hi>VVhom we preach, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man, and teaching every man in all VViſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Christ Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this ignorance we doubt hath happened unto many, not only from a Principle of having their <hi>Eyes out unto man;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> but alſo from a <hi>neglect to read the Scriptures of Truth, given forth by inſpiration, which</hi> (the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>are able to make thee VViſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the word <hi>[Knowledge]</hi> this may be added, That in the want thereof in days paſt, thoſe who are eſcaped of the Nations ſet up their Graven-images, according as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet teſtified, <hi>They have no knowledge,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 45.20.</note> that ſet up the Wood of their Graven Images, and pray unto a God that cannot ſave;</hi> Oh! that at this day there were no cauſe to take up a Lamentation, that the want of Knowledge is the cauſe that many have appeared ready to <hi>exalt man,</hi> to <hi>have an eye to men,</hi> and (in neglect of that heavenly Gift which is given unto Mankind) to <hi>bow in their Hearts unto Men,</hi> as having a dependency on the <hi>Dictates, Preſcriptions, Orders,</hi> and <hi>Outward Rules of Man:</hi> this under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel of Chriſt, we take to be as great a falling away from the Truth, as the ſetting up of a graven image (through the want of Knowledge) was under the Law; and that at this day the words of the Prophet are again fulfilling,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.6.</note> 
                        <hi>My People are deſtroyed for lack of Knowledge; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt rejected Knowledge, I will alſo reject thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis now needful to ſignifie the occaſion on which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Paul ſaith, <hi>that Knowledge puffeth up.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 Cor. 8.1. <hi>Now as touching things offered unto Idols,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57559:107"/>we know, that we have all Knowledge; Knowledge puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, but Charity edifieth.</hi> And further in the ſame chap. ver. 10, 11. <hi>If any man ſee thee, which haſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſit at meat in the Idols Temple, ſhall not the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of him which is weak be emboldned to eat thoſe things which are offered unto Idols? and through thy knowledge ſhall the weak Brother periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Chapter the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a Reproof to ſuch as (abounding in Knowledge, and clearly ſeeing, that to put a difference between Meat offered unto Idols, and that which was not, was but the fruit of weakneſs) had not a regard unto the weak Conſciences of their Brethren, and ſo he tells ſuch, <hi>Knowledge puffeth up, but Charity edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> From whence we cannot conclude, that <hi>Paul</hi> meant ſtrictly according as his words may be conſtrued, no more than he intended by his ſaying, <hi>Let your Women keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the Church,</hi> that none of them, though Members of the Church ſhould propheſie when moved of God; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in a few verſes before, he tells the Church (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of Women as well as Men) <hi>They might all propheſie one by one;</hi> and the reaſon ſeems evident, becauſe the <hi>Knowledge</hi> which the Apoſtle ſeems to hint at, was a <hi>Knowledge</hi> ſprung from a growth in the Truth, that the weak had not attained unto; which may be taken to be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in theſe words of the ſaid Chapter, <hi>VVe know that we all have knowledge; howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge; for ſome with Conſcience of the Idol unto this hour eat it, as a thing offered unto an Idol, and their conſcience being weak, is defiled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All which being conſidered, the Mind of the Apoſtle writing thoſe words, <hi>viz. Knowledge puffeth up, but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity edifieth,</hi> may be taken to be this, that though they had <hi>Knowledge,</hi> yet they ſhould not have their Eye ſo much to that, as to exerciſe their Liberty to the offence of any that were weak, leſt the Enemy to <hi>true Knowledge</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57559:107"/>ſhould interpoſe, and puff them up, ſo as not to condeſcend through Charity, for the ſake of a weak Brother.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the work of the Enemy of man's Soul to puff up; but the Word of Knowledge is one of the Gifts,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7, 8.</note> which through the manifeſtation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are given unto every man to profit withal; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, that the Apoſtle writing unto the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> thus expreſt himſelf,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.9, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in Knowledge, and in all Judgment; that ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be ſincere, and without offence.</hi> From whence it may reaſonably be concluded, that the contrary Fruits, <hi>viz. things that are contemptible,</hi> and <hi>vile, inſincere</hi> and <hi>offenſive,</hi> ſpring through the Want of that Love which abounds in Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>By this diſcourſe you ſeem to exalt Knowledge as an excellent thing;

                           </note> How comes it then to paſs, that divers amongſt you (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Quakers) have preached reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly on ſuch as are indued with knowledge above many of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as if their Religion were in their Heads, and not in their hearts; telling us, That the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was not good for Food; and not only ſo, but have appeared in ſuch an invective Spirit againſt Reaſon alſo, without diſtinction, that in your publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this imperative Expreſſion hath been uttered, <hi>Away with all Reaſoning.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis very true: However, that doth not prove, that all ſuch Expreſſions are according to the Truth: Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tongues are their own, and we cannot uſe Violence to prevent any from delivering that which they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57559:108"/>they have to ſay; and therefore for the clearing of the Truth, in relation to the aforeſaid objection, we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add:</p>
                     <p>Pure Religion and undefiled is, to viſit the Fatherleſs and the Widows, and to keep unſpotted of the World; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if our heads be not exerciſed, our hearts will not bring forth the Fruit thereof.</p>
                     <p>As to to the Tree of <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> though the Scriptures do not poſitively declare, whether it was good for Food or no (as in itſelf,) yet it doth clearly import, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin (in eating of the <hi>Tree of Knowledge</hi>) was the Sin of Rebellion, for that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to eat thereof: A Father may command his Child not to eat an <hi>Apple,</hi> and yet give him leave to eat of <hi>other food,</hi> fitter at that ſeaſon for him; if the Child ſhould therein diſobey his Father, his <hi>rebellious eating</hi> would be no Argument to prove the <hi>Apple in itſelf not good for food.</hi> Theſe things being conſidered, it may reaſonably be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that there is no Ground to aſſert, that the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was not good for Food, as in itſelf.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it hath been much obſerved, that when the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid doctrine hath been by ſome declared, it hath been by way of Reflection on the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which ſome of the Publiſhers thereof account <hi>ſenſual and deviliſh</hi> (though others have not thereby ſo intended) but therein they have manifeſted their own Weakneſs, becauſe that which is a Diſcoverer of Good and Evil (being in it ſelf good, as the Tree of Knowledge is) cannot be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Compariſon or Alluſion to repreſent the thing that is deviliſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt teſtifies, <hi>This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,
<note place="margin">John 17.3.</note> and Jeſus Christ whom thou hast ſent.</hi> And yet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57559:108"/>many of thoſe who cry up Life, are apt to cry down Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without diſtinction, though 'tis evident that <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the way to life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things being duly conſidered, we know not on what foot of Truth any one can aſſert, <hi>that the Tree of Knowledge is not good for food, as in itſelf;</hi> and that it can be a proper ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, to repreſent any thing that is in oppoſition to that <hi>Knowledge</hi> which is from above: But yet I would not be underſtood to reflect on all that have uſed that expreſſion, <hi>viz.

                     <p>ON this Subject 'tis neceſſary to treat, as it relates to the Magiſtracy and People of <hi>England,</hi> whereof the people called Quakers are a part.</p>

We acknowledge that we owe <hi>Obedience</hi> either <hi>Active</hi> or <hi>Paſſive</hi> unto this <hi>Magiſtracy;</hi> and that ſuch obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is as well grounded on the Light of Chriſt within, as warrantable from the Scriptures of Truth without; for when the Magiſtrate doth command <hi>Obedience</hi> unto any Law, which is agreeable to the Law of God (as indeed no Laws of <hi>England</hi> according to the Conſtitution of its <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and thoſe <hi>maxims</hi> which are declared for Law, ought to be contrary thereto) then we ought to yield <hi>Active Obedience;</hi> and whilſt the Magiſtrates are in Execution of ſuch Laws, they are (as occaſion requires) Puniſhers of thoſe that do Evil,

                     <p>Obj. <hi>You ſpeak very well ſo far as you have limited your Obedience to Good Laws; but what if thoſe in power ſhould make ſuch Laws, which you account bad, and not grounded on the Law of God, but directly againſt thoſe whom you term God's People; dare you then ſay that 'tis agreeable unto the Light of

<note place="margin">Iſa. 2.4.</note> 
                        <hi>He ſhall judge among the Nations, and ſhall rebuke many people, and they ſhall beat their Swords into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their Spears into pruning-hooks: Nation ſhall

                     </p>
                     <p>To this we anſwer, If any have given juſt Occaſion for this <hi>Objection,</hi> 'tis to be lamented, becauſe the great ſign of taking up the Croſs is, to <hi>deny Self,</hi> according to the words of Chriſt, <hi>If any man will come after me,
<note place="margin">Mat 16.24.</note> let him <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> and take up his Croſs and follow me.</hi>

                     <p>Beſides, we do teſtifie, the principle of Truth leads none to be <hi>Rude,</hi> either in Word or Action; nor yet to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57559:112"/>croſs the Cuſtoms and Faſhions of other Societies, which in themſelves are Comely, Decent, and of Good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That the Preaching of the Croſs is to them that periſh,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18.</note> fooliſhneſs; but unto us which are ſaved, it is the power of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An Earthly-Spirited man may become <hi>ſingular,</hi> and <hi>croſs</hi> unto all others, and yet not denying himſelf through the Operation of the Power of God, may therein be an enemy to the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Another man may be made Partaker of the Power of God unto Salvation, and yet not led by his Spirit to act <hi>croſs</hi> unto all others, though through the denial of <hi>Self,</hi> he may be truly exerciſed in the Croſs of Chriſt; and therein acting many things, which ſome (through Envy or want of right Underſtanding) may term the Fruit of <hi>Rudeneſs and Ignorance,</hi> when not ſo in itſelf.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, therefore we ſay, 'tis Good for every one in all things to mind the inward, divine and ſpiritual Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that ſo none may run before that Guide, and then doubtleſs ſuch will be led to take up the <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>denial of Self,</hi> and not be active in any thing that may juſtly be termed <hi>Rude</hi> or <hi>Ignorant,</hi> but in thoſe things that are <hi>Comely, Decent</hi> and of <hi>Good Report.</hi>

                     <p>THe payment of <hi>Tythes,</hi> as a maintenance to that Prieſthood, which we were led to teſtifie againſt at our firſt Convincement of the Truth, was generally denied, as that which in Truth could not be owned, though the Claimers thereof have pretended thereto, ſometimes by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right,</hi> and ſometimes by <hi>Humane Inſtitution,</hi> and ſometimes by <hi>both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to a claim by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> though they were ſo due under the firſt Covenant, yet that cannot be convincingly urged from the Scriptures of Truth under a Goſpel-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; for the Author to the Hebrews thus informs us, <hi>They that are of the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>who receive the Office of the Prieſthood, have a Commandment to take Tythes of the People, according to the Law,</hi> Heb. 7.5. But verſe 12. he thus ſaith, <hi>The Prieſthood being changed, there is made of neceſſity a Change alſo of the Law.</hi> And verſe the 18th of the ſame Chapter, he thus ſaith, <hi>There is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a diſannulling of the Commandment going before.</hi> Which clearly evidences, that ſince the <hi>Law is changed,</hi> and the <hi>Commandment diſannulled</hi> (by which <hi>Tythes</hi> were paid) <hi>the payment thereof by vertue of that Law ceaſeth,</hi> and ſo all claim thereto by <hi>Divine Right</hi> (ſince no Goſpel-inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be quoted) ceaſeth alſo.</p>
                     <p>Moreover we find that <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived about two hundred years after Chriſt, doth thus write, (1 Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. cap. 39.) <q>Neque pretio ulla res Dei conſtat: etiam

                     <p>TIs evident from the Scriptures of Truth,
<note place="margin">Mat. 1.12.</note> that the <hi>Baptiſm of water was the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> John, who was ſent a Meſſenger, to prepare the way of Chriſt before him; and that though he was ſent to baptiſe with Water unto Repentance, yet he thus teſtified, in relation to Chriſt;

                        <hi>He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whoſe Shoes I am not worthy to bear; he ſhall baptiſe you with the holy Ghoſt and with Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now foraſmuch as Chriſt himſelf was baptiſed by <hi>John,</hi> and after his Reſurrection exhorted his Diſciples on this wiſe, <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations,
<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> baptiſing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things that I have commanded you; and lo I am with you unto the End of the World.</hi> It is concluded by many, that the <hi>Baptiſm of VVater</hi> ought alſo to continue unto the <hi>End of the VVorld,</hi> as a Goſpel Ordinance, to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by thoſe who are called into the Work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1ſt. It doth not appear from the recited Scripture, that the Diſciples were hereby commiſſionated to Baptiſe with Water; and though it may be urged, that the Practice of
<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 8.38. Act. 10.47.</note> 
                        <hi>Philip</hi> to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and the words of <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewed, that Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Baptiſm of VVater,</hi> and that that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was to be adminiſtred by Goſpel Miniſters for ever; yet that's no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57559:117"/>more an infallible Proof thereof,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17.</note> than <hi>Paul</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He was not ſent to Baptiſe,</hi> is a proof that he was either <hi>no Apoſide,</hi> or that <hi>Chriſt gave no ſuch Commiſſion, Go teach all Nations, baptiſing them,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if every one that was ſent to <hi>teach,</hi> was alſo ſent to <hi>baptiſe,</hi> then <hi>Paul</hi> could not in truth have ſaid, <hi>I was not ſent to baptiſe,</hi> if in reality he was commiſſioned to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>preach;</hi> which none under <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-profeſſion (as we know of at this day) queſtions.</p>
                     <p>Moreover we put this query to every enlightned impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader, <hi>Whether there be not cauſe to doubt, that the very Diſciples themſelves might not be as remote from having a true Savour of the Meaning of Chriſt in theſe words, <hi>[baptiſing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt,]</hi> as ſome of Chriſt's Diſciples</hi> Joh. 6.53. <hi>were in theſe his words, <hi>[Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his Blood, ye have no life in you?]</hi>
                        </hi> For Chriſt's meaning thereby was not, that the fleſh did profit,
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.61.</note> as is plain by theſe his words, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Fleſh profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing; the Words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they are Life:</hi> Yet for want of true diſcerning what Chriſt meant by eating of his Fleſh, until he explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, many of his Diſciples ſaid, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> Read <hi>John</hi> 6. from <hi>verſe</hi> 47. to <hi>verſe</hi> 64. But notwithſtanding we would not be underſtood poſitively to affirm, that Chriſt intended not a <hi>Baptiſm of Water,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 4.2.</note> as needful to be adminiſtred by ſome (by reaſon of the Weakneſs of the People) for a ſeaſon; becauſe 'tis evident, that not only Chriſt's diſciples before he was Crucified (when it appears not that they had any Power to baptiſe with the Spirit) did baptiſe; but alſo, that ſome after that time of his being Crucified,
<note place="margin">Act. 8.16, 29, 36, 37.</note> were baptiſed in the name of the Lord Jeſus; and yet they had not received the holy Ghoſt:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57559:117"/>which being compared with what is written touching the <hi>Eunuch</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 38.39.</note> who by the Spirit was bid to <hi>Go near</hi> and <hi>Join himſelf to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch's Chariot,</hi> doth clearly import, that <hi>Water baptiſm</hi> was uſed, as well after the Crucifying of Chriſt, as before. <hi>But whether by vertue of any command from Chriſt ſo to do, is yet the queſtion, and uncertain from any poſitive Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> However, ſuppoſe that the <hi>Baptiſm of Water</hi> was the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> intended by Chriſt in the words, <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptiſing them,</hi> &amp;c. it then ſeems naturally to follow, that this was but a Confirmation of <hi>John</hi>'s Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and that (being a Legal Adminiſtration) but for a ſeaſon, and not to the End of the World: and was not that baptiſm wherewith <hi>John</hi> teſtified,
<note place="margin">Luk. 25.49. Act. 1.4. Act. 2.4.</note> Chriſt ſhould baptiſe, which was <hi>with the holy Ghoſt and with Fire;</hi> eſpecially if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that Chriſt was not yet aſcended, after which the promiſe of the Father was to be fulfilled, <hi>viz. the pouering forth of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which undoubtedly was the <hi>Baptiſm of the Spirit;</hi> and that every <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was not that <hi>Baptiſm of the Spirit,</hi> as is clearly ſignified, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>Who when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the holy Ghoſt; for as yet he was faln on one of them, only they were baptiſed in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All which being duly weighed, it's rational to conclude, that the <hi>Baptiſm of Water ought to end in time;</hi> and that theſe words, <hi>And lo I am with you unto the End of the World,</hi> are no ſufficient ground to believe, that the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Water</hi> was thereby intended to continue as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, unto the diſſolution of all things.</p>
                     <p>But could nor ſo much be ſaid, as already is, to evidence that the continuance thereof to the End of the World was not the meaning of Chriſt unto his diſciples, yet it may
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57559:118"/>be affirmed, that the words themſelves in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, if we compare Scripture with Scripture, will not hold forth ſuch an interpretation.</p>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which may properly be tranſlated in the conſummation of Ages; experience tells us, as well as the ſignification of words, that theſe words are not ſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57559:118"/>intelligibly tranſlated, as they might, ſince it now relates to time above ſixteen hundred years paſt.</p>
                     <p>Now foraſmuch as we find, that in this ſentence, <hi>And lo, I am with you alway, unto the End of the World;</hi> the ſame greek words are rendred to ſignifie <hi>the End of the World,</hi> as is in the aforeſaid quotation to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a time above ſixteen hundred years paſt (ſaving only that the word [<gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Luk. 22.19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>And he took Bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, ſaying, This is my Body, which is given for you; <hi>this do in remembrance of me;</hi> Likewiſe alſo the Cup after Supper, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for you.</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57559:120"/>it appears groundleſs to us; for <hi>verſe</hi> the 44th 'tis ſaid, <hi>All that believed were together, and had all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> the 46th thus, <hi>And they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking Bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their own meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, praiſing God.</hi> Theſe Scriptures being duely weighed clearly manifeſt, that as often as they did cat, they had all things common, and praiſed God, and that here's no ground to believe, that the daily <hi>Breaking of Bread,</hi> there ſpoken of, had a relation to <hi>daily, ſolemn, appointed Meetings,</hi> wherein the Apoſtles did take bread, bleſs, break it, and diſtribute it, under the notion of a Sign unto them, that they were made Partakers of the Body of Chriſt, whereby the Soul is nouriſhed; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that at thoſe Opportunities, their outward Bodies and Hunger were refreſhed and ſatisfied; which in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſenſe was not eating of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22, 33, 34. Moreover, if we do but compare the aforeſaid Scriptures <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42, 46. with what is written <hi>Acts</hi> 6. <hi>from the beginning to the</hi> 7th <hi>verſe,</hi> 'tis rational to conclude, that in their daily breaking bread from houſe to houſe, no other Inſtitution, Ordinance, or Sacrament was hinted at, than what was neglected toward the <hi>Grecian</hi> widows, mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 6.1. which Neglect occaſioned a choice of ſeven Deacons, becauſe 'twas not judged reaſonable, that the Apoſtles ſhould leave the Word of God, and ſerve Tables; which ſervice there hinted at, was doubtleſs a Miniſtration of <hi>Outward Food,</hi> for the <hi>nouriſhment of the Outward Man,</hi> and not the <hi>nouriſhment of the ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 'Tis thus ſaid, <hi>And upon the firſt day of the week, when the Diſciples came together to break Bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow, and continued his ſpeech until midnight;</hi> and in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes 'tis ſignified, that <hi>when</hi> Paul <hi>came up again (from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57559:121"/>taking up a young man, who, as</hi> Paul <hi>was long preaching, ſunk down with ſleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead) and had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long time, even until break of day, he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On this Scripture it may be obſerved, that no mention is made, that the aforeſaid <hi>Breaking of Bread</hi> was done in purſuance of any Inſtitution made by Chriſt at his Laſt Supper; nor yet that the end thereof was, that they might be on that occaſion, in a more ſolemn Commemoration of the Death of Chriſt, than at other times, wherein they might refreſh their <hi>outward man with Carnal food;</hi> and therefore though I cannot but have ſo much Charity for the Diſciples of Chriſt, as to believe, that when they did ſo eat (as aforeſaid) they were in the remembrance of the Benefits through Chriſt's Death (as every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ought to be, and more eſpecially whilſt participating of his Mercies) yet the Scriptures already named, ſeem no rational Proof of any ſuch ſolemn Inſtitution made by Chriſt, which many under the Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> pretend to have practiſed.</p>
                     <p>1 Cor. 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſidering the mind of the ſpirit through the Apoſtle in the very ſame Epiſtle, we appeal unto ſuch who are knowing in the Myſteries of God's Kingdom, whether 'tis not unreaſonable to take the Meaning of the Spirit to be, that this had a Tendency to Encourage Outward Meetings, wherein Outward Bread ought to be broken and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, as a Sign of being Partakers of Chriſt's Body, or to prove any ſolemn Inſtitution made by Chriſt, more than what may as well be alledged from the words of <hi>John</hi> to be then inſtituted by Chriſt, when he ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 6.51, 56. <hi>I am the living Bread which cometh down from heaven, if
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57559:121"/>any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever; he that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> For we find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the very next verſe, thus ſignifying; <hi>For we being many, are one Bread and one Body; for we are Partakers of that one Bread.</hi> This one bread whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, is not outward Bread, but Chriſt and his Church, dwelling each in other, according to the aforeſaid Teſtimony of Chriſt, <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25, 26. Paul thus ſaid, <hi>For I have received of the Lord that which alſo I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus the ſame night in which he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, took Bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, this Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood; this do ye as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Scripture is taken as a pertinent Proof for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament of the Supper (ſo called) as a Goſpel Ordinance.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing needful to be conſidered, in order to the having a right underſtanding of the mind of the Spirit through <hi>Paul</hi> in this matter is, the occaſion whereon 'twas written, which is ſignified from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to 23. of the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> from whence it appears, <hi>That the</hi> Corinthians <hi>came not toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>her for the better, but for the worſe; for that when they came together,</hi> Paul <hi>heard there were diviſions amongſt them, and that in eating, every one took before the other his own ſupper, and that one was hungry, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drunken, and that this was not to eat the Lord's Supper;</hi> and then proceeds to relate, what he had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57559:122"/>unto them, as an evidence that their Practice was not to be juſtified, or owned from any thing delivered unto them by him.</p>
                     <p>'Tis now neceſſary to conſider, <hi>what may,</hi> and <hi>what may not be inferred,</hi> as pertinent to the matter in hand, from what <hi>Paul</hi> delivered to the <hi>Corinths.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It cannot be inferred that thoſe who worthily did eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup, mentioned verſes 24, 25. (which we will not deny to be outward) were after the receiving thereof made Partakers of Chriſt's Body; for though <hi>ver.</hi> 27. the Apoſtle thus ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord;</hi> yet he doth not on this occaſion ſay, <hi>that the Worthy Receiver is Partaker of the Body of Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>why?</hi> but becauſe that was not the declared end, <hi>what then was the declared end?</hi> the end from <hi>Paul</hi>'s words ſeems to be, <hi>to ſhew the Lord's death till he come,</hi> for verſe 26. he thus ſaith, <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till he come;</hi> in remembrance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of man may be, and yet no Partaker of his Body: and as to theſe words <hi>[till he come]</hi> they may reaſonably be taken to relate to his coming to man in Spirit; and if ſo, there is no pretence from <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, that ſuch ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the aforeſaid Practice, for the remembrance of Chriſt's Death, who are witneſſes of his coming in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which (as living members of his ſpiritual Body) they are attained unto the End, wherefore a remembrance of his Death was accounted <hi>needful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as to theſe words, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord <hi>unworthily,</hi> ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord;</hi> it may be ſaid, that no command is herein contained to prove, that the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper</hi> (ſo called) ought to be, or to have been practiſed; but yet we confeſs, that from theſe words it's
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57559:122"/>Rational to conclude, That <hi>Paul</hi> had a Senſe, that ſome might take occaſion to meet together to break Bread, and to Drink; and foraſmuch as the uſe thereof was abuſed, it might be a neceſſary Caution in <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſignify, that the <hi>Unworthy Eaters were guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt;</hi> becauſe if they made Conſcience thereof, (as doubtleſs thoſe who ſo practiſed, would profeſs they did, even as ſome others made Conſcience of <hi>Obſerving a Day</hi>) the Abuſe thereof could not but become Sin unto them, by which the Juſt is Crucifyed: And therefore, <hi>Such might as Justly be accounted Guilty of the Body, and Blood of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>as thoſe; who having taſted of the Good Word of</hi> God, <hi>were by their Falling away accounted Crucifyers of the Son of</hi> God <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and Putters of him to open Shame;</hi> read <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, 6. And though we have repeated the 23, 24, 25. <hi>Verſes;</hi> yet they being chiefly a Repetition of the Words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken to in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> we ſhall ſay the leſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and at preſent, take notice only of theſe words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, <hi>viz. <hi>This do in Remembrance of me:</hi>
                        </hi> Had theſe Words been omitted by <hi>Luke,</hi> as they are by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> on the ſame Occaſion, there would be no Pretence from the Scriptures of Truth, to call <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread at his Laſt Supper, an <hi>Ordinance of Chriſt, to continue for-ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, 'tis worthy our Obſervation, That <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt wholly omits that Narration, given by <hi>Mathew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 13.</note> from whence the <hi>Sacrament of the Supper,</hi> (ſo called) is contended for; more than to ſay, <hi>He riſeth from Supper:</hi> and yet doth expreſly unto his Diſciples, after Supper was ended, thus ſay;

                        <hi>Ye call Me <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Lord;</hi> and ye do well; for ſo I am: if I then, your Lord and Maſter, have waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one anothers Feet; for I

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Things being the Things of <hi>God,</hi> ought to be weighed,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 5.</note> and pondered by his Spirit; and thoſe who ſo do, will clearly diſcern, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by that Outward Action of waſhing the Diſciples Feet, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew unto his Diſciples a Pattern of Humility, and an Example of Readineſs to ſerve one another in Love; but alſo, to figure forth unto them, the Neceſſity of being <hi>Waſhed, Cleanſed,</hi> and <hi>Purifyed in the Inward Man;</hi> and that, <hi>Otherwiſe there is no having a Part in Chriſt:</hi> and this is clearly ſignifyed in the Words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto <hi>Peter; Then cometh he to</hi> Simon Peter;
<note place="margin">John 13.6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>and</hi> Peter <hi>ſaith unto him, Lord, Doſt thou waſh my Feet?</hi> Jeſus <hi>anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſaid, What I do, thou knoweſt not now; but thou ſhalt know hereafter:</hi> Which clearly ſhews, that there was a Spiritual Signification hinted at by <hi>Christ</hi>'s Outward Waſhing, for that <hi>Peter</hi> did know his Outward Waſhing; and therefore ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Verſe</hi> 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt never waſh my Feet:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Jeſus</hi> anſwered him thus; <hi>If I waſh thee not, Thou haſt no Part in me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All which being duly weighed, it appears, that there is as much Ground at this Day from the Scripture of Truth, to practiſe the <hi>Waſhing of one anothers Feet,</hi> and call ſuch a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, a <hi>Sacrament, to figure forth the Blood of Chriſt, in which the Sins of thoſe, who are quickned unto God, are waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> as the Eating of Bread, and Drinking of Wine, in Imitation of what was Practiſed or Commanded by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Night before he was Betrayed, may.</p>
                     <p>And now, on the Behalf of our Selves, and all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light, amongſt thoſe called <hi>Quakers;</hi> may it at this Day be ſaid, That though we are not found in that Outward Practice of <hi>Waſhing one anothers Feet,</hi> as a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Exerciſe, after that Outward Example, which was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57559:123"/>given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto his Diſciples, the Night before he was Betrayed, and enjoyned as their Duty; nor yet are found in the Practice of Appointing certain Times and Seaſons, on purpoſe to eat Bread, and drink Wine, as that which we ought (Religiouſly) to do in a more ſolemn Manner, than at other times: Yet we can boldly ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord and Maſter, ſpeaks no more Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto us, as Perſons, in that reſpect, neglecting any thing that he hath inſtituted for us to practiſe, than he doth to many Elders of the Church at this Day; who, <hi>Viſiting the Sick, neglect to anoint with Oyl in the Name of the Lord:</hi> and to others, who being of the <hi>Gentile</hi>-Stock, according to the Fleſh, <hi>Do not abſtain from eating Blood;</hi> and yet in neither of theſe reſpects, Condemned; though expreſly Exhorted to by the Apoſtle; read <hi>Acts</hi> 15.20. <hi>James</hi> 5.14.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it is to be conſidered, that though the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper,</hi> (ſo called) is by ſome reputed to be Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10, 14.</note> even as <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is taken to be Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the room of <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> yet both are groundleſs: For, though the Scripture Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>That the Feaſt of the Paſſover was to be kept by an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance forever;</hi> yet when the Time of Reformation came, it ended, even as all thoſe Outward Services and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which ſtood only in Meats, and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and Carnal Ordinances, impoſed until the Time of Reformation, did. Now, foraſmuch as the Time of Reformation, was the Time wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> through the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf without Spot unto <hi>God;</hi> we query, <hi>Whether after this Time of Reformation, it can be conſiſting with the Spirit of Truth, for any one to impoſe upon the People of the Lord, (or for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57559:124"/>of the Lord, though not impoſed upon) to practiſe ſuch Ordinances, as conſiſt in Outward Meats, Drinks, and Waſhings, (as the Ordinances of Baptiſm, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper,</hi> ſo called, <hi>do</hi>) <hi>as needful, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Salvation of Mankind? Since not only the Author to the</hi> Hebrews <hi>teſtifies. That the like Ordinances under the Firſt Covenant had an End, when the Law was changed; but that</hi> Paul <hi>likewiſe exhorts againſt the</hi> Uſe of Ordinances after the Commandement and Doctrines of Men, <hi>as is largely declared to the</hi> Coloſſians, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 2.8, 14, 16. <hi>to the End? And, Whether the Introducing thereof at this Day, is not a Building again the Things that have been (according to the Doctrine of Truth) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude; This is the Teſtimony of Truth, that is with us to give on this Occaſion; That we are not at this Day convinced in our Conſciences, That there is any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ground for the Practice of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Breaking of Outward Bread,</hi> (as Ordinances under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, in this our Day) than the Commandments and Doctrines of Men; but yet are Witneſſes, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come in Spirit unto the <hi>Children of Light;</hi> and that, at the Hearing of his Voice, they have opened the Door of their Hearts,
<note place="margin">

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> knowing, that the <hi>Kingdom of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in Meats, and in Drinks; but in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy-Ghost:</hi> And therefore, having received an Earneſt of that Life, which is Eternal, (through Faith in the Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> who was offered up a Sacrifice unto <hi>God,</hi> for the Redemption
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57559:124"/>of Mankind) do inwardly feel the Benefit of that Offering; and ſo, (being ſenſible,

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Objection</hi> ſeems to be raiſed by ſuch, as have put their Meanings on the Scriptures of Truth; when in truth they cannot ſay, <hi>That by the Revelation of the Spirit of God they have been led thereto:</hi> And therefore, ſuch <hi>Meanings</hi> may well be taken to be no other, than meer <hi>Private Interpretations,</hi> and not that which is ſignifyed by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> However, that our Senſe, relating to the Material Parts of the <hi>Objection,</hi> may be known, we thus ſay:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Justification</hi> unto Life Eternal, (or a State of Salvation) is not attainable, but through Faith in the Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the Leadings of <hi>God</hi>'s Grace, that hath appeared unto all Men; and that nothing, which we of our ſelves are capable to perform, can in any wiſe be ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57559:125"/>Meritorious, as thereby to render us worthy of that <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> which all the Saints in Light are attained unto, as abſolutely neceſſary to the being made a Partaker of the great Salvation of <hi>God.</hi> By theſe our words, <hi>Nothing which we of our ſelves are capable to perform,</hi> our Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not only, an <hi>Excluſion of all legal Performances,</hi> which the Apoſtles, in their Epiſtles, plentifully hinted at; but alſo, of all other <hi>Outward Dutyes</hi> and <hi>Performances,</hi> of what Nature and Kind ſoever, that our Outward Man is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (without the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of <hi>God</hi>) to act, and bring forth.</p>
                     <p>And if any from theſe words in the <hi>Objection</hi> (viz. <hi>Wrought in them, Act of Faith, Evangelical Obedience,</hi> &amp;c.) ſhall conclude, that the very Works and Actions, which by the Spirit of God we are enabled to bring forth, are of no Advantage towards Eternal Salvation, but that it's through Faith alone attainable: We then thus Anſwer, That the word <hi>Faith</hi> in the Scripture, may be taken in a two-fold ſenſe; the one is a Faith that is not (without a further growth) accompanyed with the Salvation of God; and therefore cannot be the Faith intended in the <hi>Objection:</hi> The other is Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, for Remiſſion of Sins; and this Faith is unto Salvation; and ſo muſt be that intended in the <hi>Objection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then this inconſiſtency with Truth plainly appears in the <hi>Objection,</hi> viz. <hi>A reliance on Faith, excluding Works wrought by the Spirit.</hi> The inconſiſtency lies here: Whereſoever a lively Faith unto Salvation is manifeſted, it is accompanyed with Fruits of the Spirit, and Evangelical Obedience, which are as inſeparable each from other, as Sanctification and Juſtification in the <hi>Objection</hi> are confeſt to be. We ſhall now prove to evince againſt all Oppoſers, the truth of what we have Aſſerted.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57559:126"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is a Faith, which, without a further growth, is not accompanyed with the Salvation of God, is evident from the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13.11. <hi>For now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed:</hi> Which clearly ſhews, that the Scripture informs us, of a Belief or Faith at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſuch as were not arrived unto (nor yet Witneſſes of) the Salvation of God: They were only come nearer unto it, than when they firſt believed, but not come at it.</p>
                     <p>And no doubt, but this Belief, or Faith, ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, was a Faith on Chriſt; that is to ſay, <hi>That He was the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. For ſo to believe, was the Work encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in the beginning, according as appears by the words of Chriſt unto the multitude, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> And this was ſaid by Chriſt in Anſwer to this Queſtion, propoſed to him by the Multitude, <hi>What ſhall we do, that we might work the Works of God?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 1.15, 16, 17, 18.</note> Beſides, we find the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, <hi>That Christ was Preached,</hi> though by ſome 'twas of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> and in <hi>Pretence:</hi> And no doubt his End was, that the Sons of Men might come to believe, <hi>That Christ was the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>That the Meſſiah, that was waited for, was come:</hi> Of whom there was an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<note place="margin">John 4.25.</note> 
                        <hi>That he ſhould tell us all things.</hi> And ſo, when the Sons of Men, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were come ſo far, as to believe, <hi>That Christ was that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, that was to come;</hi> there was Ground of Hope, that they might in due time come to Witneſs the Obedience of Faith unto Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> 
                        <hi>That Jeſus is the Author and Finiſher of our Faith.</hi> No doubt this was not a Work done in a Moment, or Twinkling of an Eye: for though he is the Author and Object of every true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Faith; yet we learn from the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57559:126"/>that ſuch as believed, <hi>That Jeſus was the Lord,</hi> ſtood in need of many
<note n="‖" place="margin">Rom. 13.13, 14. Heb. 10.23, 24.</note> Exhortations, Reproofs and Inſtructions; and that God made uſe of Inſtruments to build them up in the moſt Holy Faith: And all this may be attributed unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> thereof: And to what <hi>End?</hi> but that, as they had believed on him, to be the Son of God, ſo they might come to grow from Strength to Strength, from Grace to Grace, until they might be living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, not only that he was the Author, and Object of their Faith; but alſo the Finiſher thereof unto Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As before is ſignified, there is a Faith in the Blood of Chriſt for Remiſſion of Sins; and this Faith is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation; and whereſoever 'tis manifeſted, 'tis accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> which are as inſeparable each from other, as <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Juſtification</hi> in the <hi>Objection</hi> are confeſt to be.</p>
                     <p>The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>That Chriſt, the Son of God, became the Author of Eternal Salvation,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> unto all them that Obey him.</hi> This ſhews, that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Chriſt (which undoubtedly is no other but Obedience of Faith) was a Qualification accompanying ſuch as were made Partakers of the Salvation of God. Who then dare ſay, <hi>Such Obedience is of no Advantage unto thoſe, who by the Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt are led thereunto?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, we find that the ſame Author writes on this wiſe, <hi>But Beloved,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.9, 10.</note> we are perſwaded better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, though we thus ſpeak; for God is not Unrighteous, to forget your Work, and Labour of Love, which ye have ſhewed towards his Name, in that ye have Ministred to the Saints, and do Miniſter.</hi> This doth not only ſhew, that <hi>Good Works</hi> accompany Salvation, but that there is a Recompence for the ſame, implyed in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57559:127"/>theſe words, <hi>For God is not Unrighteous, to forget your Work and Labor.</hi> Who then dare ſay, <hi>That 'tis no advantage unto Salvation to thoſe who are found Exerciſing themſelves by the Spirit of God, in things accompanying Salvation?</hi> Eſpecially ſince we ſind the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> not only to Exhort us, <hi>To work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling;</hi> but expreſly ſignifying, <hi>That Godly Sorrow worketh Repentance to
<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.10.</note> Salvation, not to be Repented of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, 'tis obſervable, that though the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>That without Faith 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God;
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is;</hi> yet he doth not reſt here, as if that Faith were ſufficient, but proceeding in the very ſame Verſe ſaith, <hi>That he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> By which it appears, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as an <hi>Act of Faith</hi> to be brought forth through Man, beſides reſting in a bare Faith, <hi>that God is,</hi> and that for ſuch <hi>Act</hi> there is a <hi>Reward;</hi> which, if duly weighed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with theſe Scripture-citations [<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12, 6.1.10.41, 42.16.27. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14.9.17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. <hi>John</hi> 2.8.] Nothing can then be more plain, than that, thoſe through whom Works (which are the Fruit of the Spirit of God, or Acts ſpringing through the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith) are brought forth, ſhall receive a Reward for ſuch Works.</p>
                     <p>And as to theſe words in the <hi>Objection, Not by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Righteouſneſs, but by Imputing the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> which we take to be grounded on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words, <hi>viz. As by one man's Diſobedience, many were made Sinners; ſo by the Obedience of One, ſhall many be made Righteous.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 19.21.</note> And God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not Imputing their Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto them; for he hath made him to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in Him.</hi> We thus Anſwer:</p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57559:127"/>
                     <p>That theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>viz. By the Obedience of one ſhall many be made Righteous,</hi> do not ſhew that any one of the Sons and Daughters of Men ſhall be made Partakers of the Righteouſneſs of God, whilſt Sin is reigning in their Mortal Bodies; the words will bear no ſuch Conſequence. And foraſmuch as ſuch, who are ready to Object as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, have highly commended the Practice of comparing Scripture with Scripture, that ſo the Truth may the more clearly ſhine forth in its Beauty, we ſhall manifeſt thereby, that no ſuch Meaning was the Meaning of the Spirit: For in the 21th. Verſe of the ſame Chapter 'tis thus ſaid, <hi>That as Sin hath reigned unto Death, even ſo might Grace reign through Righteouſneſs unto Eternal Life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This <hi>Reign of Sin</hi> was in the Mortal Bodies of thoſe, that through a breach of the Righteous Law of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubject to Condemnation: But when Grace came to Reign, through Righteouſneſs unto Eternal Life, then the Vertue of the Blood of Chriſt was witneſſed, and <hi>The Myſtery of Faith revealed,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.9.</note> that was held in a pure Conſcience;</hi> which doubtleſs was not then a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Conſcience:</hi> And therefore we may properly term the Blood of Chriſt (in which by Faith Salvation is known) the <hi>Myſtery through which man arrives unto Godlineſs;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> hath wrought in ſome, to pretend Salvation thereby, whilſt (being in a State of Degeneration) their Conſciences are poluted, and Sin reigning in their Mortal Bodies. Then we may alſo ſay, that the man of Sin was Dethroned. Then the Old Man with his Deeds was put off, and the New Man (which as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> 
                        <hi>After God is created in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and True Holineſs</hi>) was put on.</p>
                     <p>Again, 'tis obſervable, that the words, <hi>Not Imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> do only argue, that their Treſpaſſes were forgiven, as neceſſary to a ſtate of Reconciliation with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57559:128"/>their Maker; but doth not at all hold forth, that they could be in ſuch a ſtate, whilſt either their former Sins were not Forgiven, or whilſt they were actually committing Sins and Treſpaſſes anew, after that they had been, through the Mercies of <hi>God,</hi> made Partakers of ſuch Forgiveneſs.</p>
                     <p>And as to theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>That we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> we alſo ſay, it will not from thence follow, that Man can become a Partaker of the Righteouſneſs of <hi>God,</hi> whilſt Sin is in Dominion in him: For the <hi>State</hi> ſpoken of, is a <hi>State in Christ.</hi> Now the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle in the very ſame Chapter, <hi>Verſe</hi> the 17th. is on this wiſe, <hi>If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature, old things are past away, all things are become new.</hi> And though this <hi>New State,</hi> was a <hi>State</hi> wherein Man was <hi>Freely</hi> Juſtified by <hi>Grace,</hi> and brought into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of <hi>God,</hi> and was Redeemed from under the Law, which conſiſted in Carnal Ordinances, <hi>that made not the Comers thereunto Perfect,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.19.</note> as pertaining unto the Conſcience, though the bringing in of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hope did;</hi> yet notwithſtanding, we do not find any ground to believe, that the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> man was thereby brought into, was ſuch a <hi>State,</hi> wherein he was not to be <hi>ſubject</hi> to a <hi>Law:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3.26.</note> For <hi>the free Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, was to extend unto theſe, who believed in him.</hi> And in that State the Works of the Law were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; ſo that there was no room for any to boaſt therein.</p>
                     <p>But then the Manner of <hi>that Excluſion (ſo that no man ſhould boast) was by the Law of Faith.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3.27.</note> Now, where a <hi>Law</hi> is, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that <hi>Obedience</hi> is due: and whenſo ever that <hi>Debt</hi> ceaſeth, the <hi>Law</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh void.</p>
                     <p>But who ſo Impious, to declare a Principle ſo Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as hath a tendency to make this <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> void? Charity obligeth us to ſuppoſe, that no <hi>Christian-profeſſor,</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:57559:128"/>would wittingly thus do: But yet we cannot but ſay, that ſo great Darkneſs hath ſeemed to over-ſhadow ſome, as that under the Notion of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, 'tis to be feared, that many have indulged ſuch a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as little to regard the Counſel of the poſtle, when he ſaid, <hi>Work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling;</hi> as if Salvation were to be obtained by an Hiſtorical Faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all ſorts of Works as unneceſſary thereto, and that a little Religion in the Head, might ſtead a man more, than a great deal in the Heart; for where an Application of <hi>Christ's Righteouſneſs</hi> is made by any perſon whatſoever, in order to the Healing of that Wound, which (through the Temptations of the grand Enemy of the Soul) man hath received (if there be not according to the counſel of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.10.</note> A Sorrow unto Repentance never to be repented of</hi>) there 'tis undoubtedly falſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; the aforeſaid Sorrow cannot rightly attend the Creature, in his <hi>loſt eſtate</hi> and <hi>condition;</hi> but, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Through a ſenſe of the prevalency of Satan by his Temptation: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Through bearing the Righteous Condemnation of the Lord, upon the Tranſgreſſing nature, that ſo through Judgment the Mercy of the Lord may be Witneſſed; and then, when the Creature comes to be made Partaker of the Mercy of the Lord, through a ſenſe of his Failing, a real Sorrow for the ſame, and bearing in Patience the Righteous Condemnation of <hi>God,</hi> than the Burthen of Sin may be removed, and the Creature witneſs a State of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things lead us to conſider, <hi>How it comes to paſs, that people profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and owning the Scriptures of Truth (and agreeing in Principles, termed</hi> Fundamental, <hi>whilſt they keep to the Language thereof) ſhould thus Diſagree?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this we ſay, That to the enlightned Eye 'tis plain, eſpecially in the Matters whereof we are now treating:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57559:129"/>and that it may be ſo to others, we deſire, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Notations may be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private Interpretation;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.20, 21.</note> that is, it ought not to be interpreted, but by the Holy Ghoſt, through whoſe Motion it was given forth; and yet ſo great is the Curioſity of Men, that they will be concerning themſelves, to put <hi>Meanings on the Scriptures of Truth,</hi> though the words themſelves will not warrant the ſame, nor the Interpreters in truth Affirm, <hi>That ſuch their Meanings are through the Revelation of the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a Proneneſs in Man, to avoid the Croſs of Chriſt, and inſtead of Entering in at a narrow Gate, to make their Paſſage into the Kingdom of Heaven, as broad as their ſenſual Wiſdom will admit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though the Language of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> be in ſubſtance one, yet the Manner of Expreſſing themſelves ſeems Contradictory to ſuch, whom the Lord hath not endued with the Knowledge of the Myſteries of his Kingdom; and ſuch a ſpirit of diſcerning, as to ſee the Occaſions on which they Writ.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion of theſe differing Apprehenſions being thus Diſcovered, 'tis now needful to ſum up the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and from thence to take occaſion to remove (ſo far as in us lies) the Miſunderſtanding of the Words of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Apoſtles; and in order thereto we thus ſay, This Diſcourſe, touching <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſome profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> are at leaſt doubtful, that others under the like Profeſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a State of <hi>Juſtification, and Salvation, through the Imputation of Chri'ſts Righteouſneſs, whil'ſt they are continuing in their Sins;</hi> and not only ſo, but that <hi>No Works wrought in us (though by the Spirit of Chriſt it ſelf) are of any Advantage to the Arriving unto the State of Justification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57559:129"/>Secondly,</hi> That others under the ſame Profeſſion of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> are Jealous, <hi>That the Principles which ſome hold forth, have a tendency to Introduce a Righteouſneſs of our own, as Meritorious to Eternal Salvation;</hi> which occaſions us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Reader</hi> to a part of an <hi>Objection,</hi> raiſed in the Third Chapter of this Treatiſe, pages 15. and 16. and to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereto, pages 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. for that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it, a very proper Concluſion to this Chapter, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the further clearing of the Truth, and dividing the Word aright, though written on another Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>That part of the Objection aforeſaid ſignified of, to be proper on this Occaſion, is as followeth.</p>

                     <p>FOraſmuch as the <hi>Title Page</hi> of this <hi>Second Part,</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in the Reader an Expectation, of ſome further Diſcovery of <hi>Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Innovation,</hi> ſince in this Part hitherto, little thereof hath been Manifeſted; We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought meet, to Add the Subſtance of an Anſwer, given by ſome Friends of <hi>Bristol</hi> to the Paper mentioned in other Parts of the <hi>Christian Quaker,</hi> to be given forth by ſixty ſix Perſons, that is to ſay, by <hi>Charles Marſhal,</hi> and ſixty five more, from <hi>Ellis Hookes</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> the Twelfth of the 4th. Month, 1677. which now follows.</p>
                     <p>We whoſe Names are here unto Subſcribed, do Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that on the Sixteenth day of the Fifth Month 1677. we were preſent in a Meeting (uſually held in the City of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,</hi> for the <hi>taking Care of the Poor,</hi> and <hi>promoting of other Christian Duties</hi>) when a Paper Subſcribed by Sixty Six <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and Dated from a Metting, held at <hi>Ellis Hookes</hi> his Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> the Twelfth of the Fourth Moneth, 1677. was there Read, and therein <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> are Reproved, and Judged in theſe Words, viz. <hi>We do hereby Reprove and Judge, that Jealous, Rending, and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Spirit, and them</hi> (meaning John Story <hi>and</hi> John Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) <hi>and their Separate Company, as being in that Spirit of Separation, and that by the Power and Spirit of our God: and we warn all to whom this Comes, to beware of the ſaid</hi> John Story, <hi>and</hi> John Wilkinſon, <hi>whoſe way at preſent is not the way of Peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaid Judgment we do now Declare, that we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57559:130"/>do not own to be <hi>Righteous;</hi> nor yet dare we deny the ſaid <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> leſt we ſin againſt <hi>God,</hi> and deſpiſe thoſe unto whom a Diſpenſation of the Goſpel of Chriſt is committed, eſpecially ſince that the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Paper doth ſufficiently manifeſt to our Conſciences, <hi>That the Spirit of God did not move in the hearts of the ſixty ſix Subſcribers, to give forth the ſame,</hi> though the Name of the Lord, his Power and Spirit is frequently made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of in the ſaid Paper, and that this is ſo, we thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The great Crime againſt <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon,</hi> is for that (as report ſaith) <hi>They have been instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſet up, or at leaſt incourage a Separate Mens-Meeting in the North,</hi> wherein the outward affairs of the Church are managed, and ſo conſequently is eſteemed, beſides that <hi>Form of Government</hi> which is contended for.</p>
                     <p>Now it doth not appear to us, from the ſaid <hi>Paper,</hi> that the Meeting, from which the aforeſaid Paper was given forth, was a Meeting held according to the <hi>Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> contended for; and ſo we are diſſatisfied, that the Actions of that Meeting are Juſtifiable, by the Rule of thoſe who oppoſe <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> on the foot of the <hi>Separate-Meeting</hi> ſo called.</p>
                     <p>For it doth not appear, that the aforementioned Meeting was the <hi>General Meeting,</hi> by any thing therein contained; not being ſo much as Dated from thence, nor yet within the time wherein it was appointed to be held; beſides, if the Paper did not prove that, yet by a <hi>Poſt-ſcript</hi> thereto it appears, that there were ſeveral Brethren, that had left the City before the ſaid Meeting, wherein the ſaid Paper was Subſcribed, and ſo (had it been within the appointed time of the <hi>General-Meeting</hi>) it could (in the beſt ſenſe) be but from a part of the ſaid Meeting.</p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:57559:131"/>
                     <p>The aforementioned Meeting, by the ſaid Paper Appears not to be the ſecond day's weekly Meeting, for its Date is on the Third Day; and when any thing is given forth, from that Meeting, 'tis uſually Dated from the ſaid Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Beſides, we find that the Hands of many Antient Labourers in the Goſpel, and the greateſt part (by many) of the Body of the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Miniſtring Friends,</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> are not thereto Subſcribed; and not only ſo, but we are Credibly Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that though 'twas diſcourſed in the Second Days Weekly Meeting, yet 'twas not unanimouſly Aſſented to therein: And if ſo, it follows by natural Conſequence, that it could not be the action of the ſaid Meeting, had it been Dated on that Day; and that this Expreſſion in the aforeſaid Paper, <hi>viz. And bleſſed and ſweet and very preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our Souls, is the Heavenly Unity of Life amongſt us, wherein at this Meeting, the Lord our God hath Crowned us with Glory, Dominion, and Peace,</hi> cannot in Truth be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, with reſpect to the aforeſaid Second Days Weekly Meetings Unity, as to the matter contained in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Paper.</p>
                     <p>The afore-mentioned <hi>Meeting,</hi> cannot be reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be from the <hi>Mens-Meeting of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
                        </hi> for that the generality of the Members thereof, have not their Hands thereto; neither is it ſaid, <hi>Signed on behalf of that Meeting,</hi> or any other ſetled Meeting in <hi>England,</hi> nor yet from it, or any other ſuch Meeting.</p>
                     <p>All which Conſiderations confirm us in this Perſwaſion, that the aforeſaid Paper was given forth from a <hi>Meeting held out of the Form of Government contended for;</hi> and ſo, by their own Rule, ought to be diſowned, by the Meetings to whom it is directed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appears, that the <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribers</hi> in their Paper, have given forth theſe Sentences, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57559:131"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>At this Meeting, the Lord our God hath Crowned us with Glory, Dominion and Peace; at this time (as on the like Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions hath been frequent with us) the Care of the Peace and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Churches of Chriſt came upon us. And are your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for his (meaning Chriſts) ſake? By that Salt that we have in our ſelves from the Lord, are we enabled to ſavour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Transformation of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> and the <hi>Scruples</hi> of the <hi>Innocent:</hi> And as to be tender of one, ſo to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And truly, that which hath encouraged us in this Epiſtle, is that good ſucceſs God hath bleſt our like endeavors in his power with.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We are Unanimouſly your Dear and Faithful Brethren, in the labour, travel, tribulation, patience, hope and rejoycing in the Kingdom of Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On theſe laſt Six Sentences we thus Obſerve, that where they have Credit, it's but too probable, that it may gain a Perſwaſion, or Belief, that the <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribers</hi> are <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſo may become a means to obtain the better Credit to their Paper: Should any thus be Perſwaded, they therein would be Miſtaken; for three or four from the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who are well known to us, are not Exerciſed in the work of the Miniſtry, beſides others from other Countries and Places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We find in the ſaid Paper theſe two following Sentences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And foraſmuch as it appears to us, that they will not come to us, nor near us in the peaceable Truth, which we have frequently truly deſired for their good; but that they will go on in their Oppoſition, refuſing to diſſolve their Separate-Company in the North, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And becauſe we are ſenſible that they have made an ill uſe of our Forbearance, even to ſtrengthen themſelves in their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57559:132"/>
                     <p>On which, we thus Obſerve, That theſe two Sentences are aſſigned as a part of thoſe conſiderations; wherefore the <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribers</hi> were (as they ſay) conſtrained, after continued Waiting and Exhortation, ſlighted by them (meaning <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi>) more publickly to Reprove and Judge them in theſe things, as by their Paper doth plainly appear; which being duly conſidered, it naturally follows, that if every one of the <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribers,</hi> have not frequently deſired <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> to come to them, they are then found in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Untruth; but we are ſatisfied in our Conſciences, on good grounds, that ſeveral perſons, who have Subſcribed the ſaid Paper, have not ſo done.</p>
                     <p>But were it ſo, that the <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribers</hi> had deſired them to come to them, and that thoſe <hi>Sixty Six</hi> were ſuch qualified Members in the Church of Chriſt, as that none, on the ſcore of <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> or <hi>Elderſhip,</hi> might have a greater pretence of Power, to call <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> before them; yet we Affirm, that neither the <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribers,</hi> nor any other Aſſembly on Earth, have Power to give Judgment in ſuch a caſe, other then for Contempt of Authority, if they had any over them, and not a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the merit of the Cauſe, though it were on the hearing of one part; and ſo much Juſtice doth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice both of Temporal and Spiritual Courts (ſo called) in <hi>England</hi> ſhew forth: But that which to us ſeems to Aggravate the Offence of the <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribers</hi> is this, <hi>John Story</hi> (being now with us) doth poſitively Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That a great part of the Subſcribers never ſpoke or ſent to him about the matter, for which he is now Judged; nor yet to <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> as <hi>John Story</hi> ſaith, ſo far as he knows: And ſo, when we conſider all Circumſtances, we have great cauſe to doubt, that not a few, but many of the Subſcribers (if not all) have given Judgment without
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57559:132"/>a hearing of either Party, for that their Paper doth not Import, that the Judgment given is on the Hearing either of one or both Parties convened before them. And as to the Meeting at <hi>Drawell</hi> (the Fame whereof hath come to our Ears) ſeveral accounts have been given of that already, and a Judgment already paſt by ſome of the <hi>Sixty Six Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers,</hi> with a Caution in the ſaid Judgment, in theſe words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And now Friends, in Gods Love, We deſire you to Suppreſs all Papers of Controverſy, relating to this Difference, that the Minds of Friends be not further Troubled and Defiled, nor this Controverſy kept any longer Alive. And we do warn all to have a care, that they be not lifted up, by reaſon of the hurt that's come upon theſe men, nor yet Inſult over them; for that ſpirit is not of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore we cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the Cauſe of the preſent Judgment ſprings from any thing acted by them, before the ſaid Meeting; but rather from ſomething ſince. And whereas it may be ſaid, That <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> gave forth a Paper at <hi>Drawell,</hi> which ſince they Diſown: This as <hi>John Story</hi> ſaith, is Wrong; and as Evidence thereto, ſaith to this purpoſe, <hi>That he owns the Paper as given forth:</hi> Yet that where any Sentence may admit of more Conſtructions than one, the Giver Forth thereof ought to Interpret for himſelf; and ſo ſaith, <hi>That he still owns the ſame with that Interpretation, He</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> Give: And if the Paper will not bear that Interpretation given by them, then let them be Judged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That 'tis not in the Power of any <hi>two</hi> or <hi>more Friends</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to Diſſolve a meeting of other Friends, and therefore great Weakneſs to Aſſign <hi>John Story's,</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon's</hi> refuſing to Diſſolve a Meeting, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for ſo ſevere a Reproof and Judgment.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57559:133"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the word <hi>Forbearance,</hi> it ſeems unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch <hi>Young Men in Truth</hi> (if peradventure they are now in the Truth) as well as in <hi>Years</hi> (as ſome of the <hi>ſixty ſix Subſcribers</hi> are known to be) to Write at the rate they have done, touching ſuch <hi>Antient Brethren, Labourers</hi> in the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> eſpecially when we conſider, how credibly it hath been reported to us, <hi>That <hi>Iohn Story</hi> and <hi>Iohn Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> as to their Doctrine and Converſation, have been even by ſome of their Oppoſers, Accounted both Sound and Blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find that the ſaid Paper is Directed to <hi>Mens Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> whom the Subſcribers Exhort, <hi>that if, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Chriſtian Dealing, ſuch Perſons perſevere and go on in their ſeparate Spirits, let Gods Truth be clear of them, and Truth ſet over their Heads, according to that Bleſſed Order of the Goſpel of Chriſt ſettled among you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this we ſay, that we have not yet been Informed by any, that either <hi>John Story,</hi> or <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> have been or are found in <hi>Oppoſition to any Order</hi> that is ſettled amongſt us in our <hi>Mens Meeting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have Diſcourſed <hi>John Story</hi> in our laſt <hi>Mens-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> about the <hi>Separate-Meeting,</hi> ſo called, in the North, and have had the view of that Paper, which is accounted the <hi>Foundation of the ſaid Meeting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The words (as to us Appears) that their Oppoſers may moſt take notice of, in the ſaid Paper, to juſtify their Senſe of <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> therein, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> And if this be not amended for time to come, we do Reſolve, That neither they ſo Choſen by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, nor we do trouble our ſelves no further, with ſuch that ſtrive and contend, in taking upon them our Work, whom we do not Imploy about our Affairs, and Concerns; and if this muſt continue, we hope to do our own Buſineſs in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57559:133"/>our ſeveral Reſpective Meetings in quietneſs, and in the Order of Truth, according to the Goſpel of Liſe.</p>
                     <p>On this we Obſerve, that there is <hi>a Reſolve not to Meet with them that Strive, and Contend, and are not employed,</hi> &amp;c. and in other parts of the Paper there are <hi>Propoſals</hi> for a <hi>Reuniting,</hi> which were not (as we are Informed) accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but this doth not amount to ſet up a <hi>Separate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> We alſo Obſerve, that <hi>Their Hope was to do their own buſineſs in their ſeveral, and reſpective Meetings;</hi> this was not a <hi>Reſolve</hi> ſo to do, or a ſetting up <hi>Another Meeting;</hi> but a <hi>Hope,</hi> &amp;c. yet ſo it is, that to this Day, there is no ſuch Meeting, as was then in their Eye or Hope, that we are Informed of: For (as we underſtand) they meet not in their ſeveral reſpective Meetings to do buſineſs; but Friends from their ſeveral and reſpective Meetings do meet (as we have been informed) at their Antient <hi>Monethly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Place</hi> in <hi>Kendal,</hi> and ſo the aforeſaid Paper cannot, in our Apprehenſion, be conſtrued according to Reaſon, to be the Foundation of the Meeting, called a <hi>Separate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> and ſo conſequently <hi>John Story</hi> being askt in our laſt <hi>Mens-Meeting</hi> whether he would diſown it, Anſwered to this Effect, <hi>That 'twould be unjust for him to <hi>Diſown</hi> it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he heard <hi>Both Parties:</hi>
                        </hi> For that would be no leſs than a <hi>Giving Judgment on the hearing of one part only,</hi> which is <hi>Unrighteous;</hi> And further ſaid, <hi>That he never intended by the Subſcription of his Name to the ſaid Paper, to lay a Foundation for a Separate Meeting; but rather lookt upon the Paper, as a fit Means to Re-unite them: And that if any can offer more <hi>Chriſtian Propoſals</hi> for their Re-uniting, he doubts not but he ſhall cloſe therewith:</hi> And further ſaid, that he remembers not, <hi>That he ever was at any, or either of thoſe Meetings accounted a <hi>Separate Meeting;</hi>
                        </hi> but poſitively ſaith, <hi>He never adviſed to the Erecting the ſame.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribers</hi> in their Paper, are found Accuſing <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> to this Effect, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>We Obſerve, that in the ſaid Paper, the Subſcribers Exhort Friends, <hi>To be Zealous for the Lord, and to ſtand up in his Spirit and Power, for the Peace of his Church;</hi> which <hi>Exhortation</hi> in it ſelf is ſound, and wholeſome: But we are very Jealous, that the ſaid Paper hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, given Life to a <hi>Contentious Spirit.</hi> For on the Fifteenth Inſtant (being the firſt Day of the Week) <hi>John Story</hi> came to our Meeting, and almoſt immediately after he had ſate down, there was one ſtood up (who, as we can prove, declared <hi>Unity</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Paper,</hi> given forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi>) and teſtified to this Effect, <hi>The Trumpet of the Lord is ſounded to Battle, and the War is begun;</hi> and ſo Exhorted on this Wiſe, <hi>Come up to Battle, and help the Lord againſt the Mighty;</hi> uſing alſo theſe Scripture Words, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz.</hi>

                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:57559:135"/>
                     <p>And in the afternoon of the ſame day, in our publick Aſſembly, <hi>Francis Lea</hi> (whilſt <hi>John Story</hi> was declaring the Word of Truth) ſtood up, and thus began: <hi>If any thing he Revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the</hi> Firſt <hi>hold his Peace,</hi> which was a clear Demonſtration of his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy;</hi> for that 'tis publickly known, he Judges <hi>John Story</hi> out of Unity with the Church, and ſo 'twas altogether wrong in <hi>Fr. Lea</hi> to introduce his Diſcourſe by a <hi>Scripture,</hi> which if proper to be ſpoken in Order to the <hi>ſilencing of one declaring;</hi> yet it ought to have been with Reſpect to <hi>one in Unity with the Church:</hi> But (as we ſaid) he ownes not <hi>John Story</hi> ſo to be; and ſo it may reaſonably be concluded, that his <hi>Hipocriſy</hi> was not only thereby made Manifeſt, but alſo (his Diſcourſe being Conſidered) that he had no <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Declare from God,</hi> on that Occaſion to the People: But yet <hi>John Story</hi> (obſerving how he introduced his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, not as an <hi>open Oppoſer</hi> of his VVords) did for the People's ſakes, and that he might Adminiſter <hi>no occaſion of Diſcord,</hi> give way, and in a few words after, drew to a Concluſion; but <hi>Francis Lea</hi>'s Diſcourſe was ſuch, both Morning and Afternoon, as gave occaſion both to Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and Prophane, publickly to Manifeſt, that we are <hi>now Divided.</hi> Now whether this be a <hi>ſtanding up in the Power and Spirit of God, for the Peace of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> or a <hi>Peace-Offering,</hi> Let thoſe who are Wiſe in Heart, Judge. But that which further Manifeſted <hi>Francis Lea's Rudeneſs</hi> is this: After <hi>Francis Lea</hi> in the Morning-Meeting, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Declaration (wherein he laid down ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Aſſertions, <hi>viz. That Two Hundred and Fifty Princes and Renowned Men in</hi> Iſrael <hi>were Revels and wicked Men,</hi> and yet alſo ſaid to this Effect, <hi>as if they were Blameleſs and Harmleſs) <hi>VVilliam Rogers</hi>
                        </hi> ſtood up, and took up his Words, and ſpoke thereon in the <hi>Words of Truth,</hi> and <hi>Sound Doctrine,</hi> that ſo the People might not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57559:135"/>go away with a <hi>Miſunderſtanding,</hi> and not as an <hi>Oppoſer of any Truth that Day Delivered,</hi> nor yet as an <hi>Oppoſer</hi> of <hi>Francis Lea,</hi> further than <hi>Francis Lea's</hi> own words <hi>Oppoſed himſelf:</hi> And yet after <hi>VVilliam Rogers</hi> had ended, <hi>Francis Lea</hi> (in a Rude manner) poured out <hi>Iudgments</hi> againſt <hi>VVilliam Rogers,</hi> calling him <hi>Rebel,</hi> and uſing that very Language, as was uſed to <hi>Elimas</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer;</hi> and this is become a Common talk, amongſt <hi>Profeſſors and Prophane,</hi> in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as well as City, which we and many Friends more do Account the Fruit of <hi>great Malice,</hi> and <hi>Un-Chriſtian-like Dealing:</hi> for we know not any thing, wherein <hi>VVilliam Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> hath forfeited his Reputation as a Man or a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things Conſidered, and that alſo it is not made Appear to our Conſciences, that <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John VVilkinſon</hi> are guilty of ſuch Crimes, and Offences, as are laid to their Charge, (which if they <hi>were,</hi> we alſo ſhould <hi>diſown them</hi>) we dare not (as we ſaid before) own the ſaid <hi>judgment</hi> to be <hi>Righteous,</hi> nor yet deny the ſaid <hi>John VVilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> leſt we ſin againſt God, and deſpiſe thoſe unto whom a Diſpenſation of the Goſpel of Chriſt is committed.</p>
                     <p>And now, our Counſel to the <hi>ſixty ſix Subſcribers</hi> is, that they mind the Peace of the Churches of Chriſt, by <hi>Calling in</hi> their Paper; for we are well ſatisfyed, that their Paper is not given forth from the Motion of Gods Spirit; and if any of the <hi>ſixty ſix Subſcribers,</hi> as men leaning upon others, have aſſerted in the Name of the Lord (when the Lord hath not ſpoken by them) and that to <hi>Defame the Brethren,</hi> their Sin will Cry aloud in the Ears of the Lord of Hoſts.</p>

                     <p>According to the aforeſaid Direction, the Anſwer of the <hi>Friends</hi> of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was ſent to <hi>London</hi> to be Communicated to the <hi>ſixty ſix Subſcribers,</hi> that met at <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi> his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whereof <hi>Charles Marſhal</hi> was one: and though ſeveral <hi>General Meetings</hi> have ſince been, yet no general <hi>Reply</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is come to any of their Hands, concerned in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Anſwer; nor yet any <hi>Excommunication</hi> for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But yet we muſt confeſs, that the <hi>Four Subſcribers</hi> thereof living in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> took upon them to ſay ſomething to one part thereof, to which a Reply was made, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting at leaſt their <hi>notorious Weakneſs,</hi> if ſo be Charity may excuſe them from <hi>willful Wickedneſs,</hi> for their replying
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57559:136"/>in the manner they did, and occaſioning others to <hi>affirm whereof they knew not:</hi> And foraſmuch as no <hi>Rejoinder</hi> is come from them to the ſaid <hi>Reply,</hi> we hope that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof is from a <hi>Convincement of their Errour,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves as they have done. We alſo muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and three other <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers</hi> to the ſaid Paper from <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi> his Chamber, did concern themſelves to give Anſwer unto ſome other part thereof, and by their <hi>Anſwer</hi> it Appears, that they cannot own the ſence of <hi>Briſtol</hi> Friends, in Denying, that it came from <hi>the general Meeting:</hi> But were it ſo, that in reality it came from them, no Doubt but the ſaid <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> and his three Companions, would have obtained from the next <hi>General Meeting,</hi> a Teſtimony to that purpoſe: but no ſuch Teſtimony or Approbation of the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from <hi>Ellis Hookes</hi> his Chamber Subſcribed by <hi>Charles Marſhal</hi> aad <hi>ſixty five</hi> more, hath to this Day been given forth, as ever we could underſtand. We alſo Confeſs, that <hi>one</hi> other <hi>Subſcriber</hi> of the ſaid Paper, writ ſomething in Vindication thereof, by way of <hi>Reply</hi> to divers Friends in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> who had given their Teſtimony againſt it likewiſe: But further Teſtimony in Writing, in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof againſt ſuch as have oppoſed it, we underſtand not. But yet ye muſt further Confeſs, that <hi>Charles Marſhal,</hi> by his late keeping on his Hat, when <hi>John Story</hi> hath been in Prayer, is no <hi>Token of his Repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Conſideration of what is thus Obſerved, is ſome ground of reaſonable Hope, that <hi>Fifty ſix</hi> of the ſaid <hi>ſixty ſix Subſcribers,</hi> are come to a Senſe of their <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and that their Underſtandings are opened to behold their Errour.</p>
                     <p>That now the <hi>Reader</hi> may have a little taſte of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in which <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> and his three Companions Writ their <hi>Reply,</hi> we think meet to Note a part thereof.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid <hi>Jaſper</hi> and his three Companions take notice
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57559:137"/>of this Poſition, contained in the Anſwer of <hi>Bristol</hi> Friends, to the ſaid Paper Subſcribed by <hi>Charles Marſhal</hi> and <hi>Sixty Five</hi> more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poſition</hi> of <hi>Bristol</hi> Friends, <hi>viz. Were it ſo that theſe</hi> Sixty Six <hi>were ſuch qualified Members in the Church of Christ, as that none on the Score of Apoſtleſhip, or Elderſhip, might have a greater pretence of Power, to call</hi> John Story <hi>and</hi> John Wilkinſon <hi>before them; yet we Affirm, that neither the ſaid</hi> Sixty Six, <hi>nor any other Aſſembly on Earth, have Power to give Judgment in ſuch a Caſe, other than for <hi>Contempt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and not a judgment on the Merit of the Cauſe, though it were on the Hearing of One Party.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwered</hi> by <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> and his three Companions, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q rend="margQuotes">"Do you not ſhew your ſelves ignorant of the Scriptures, and of the Power &amp; judgment given to the Saints of the moſt High, and of the Anointing, by which the Saints did know, and were to try the Spirits? And was this Tryal to be without Judgment? Or, were not the Saints to Judge? or was that Judgment, which they were to give, only in <hi>Contempt?</hi> or whether did not they judge the <hi>Merits of the Cauſe,</hi> as well as <hi>Contempt of Authority?</hi> Though we grant they did Judge <hi>Contempt of Authority,</hi> which alſo is <hi>for</hi> Judgment, as you may Read both in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude;</hi> for we ſee there were ſuch in thoſe Days, as is now, <hi>Who did deſpiſe Government, Preſumptuous, Self-willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak Evil of Dignities, which have forſaken the right way, and gone aſtray, and ſo Wells without Water, and Clouds that are carried with a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, <hi>Theſe be they who ſeparate themſelves:</hi> Read <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> through, and let thoſe Scriptures be rightly applied, and ſee to whom they belong. And further, did not <hi>Paul</hi> judge the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> when he Wrote to them at <hi>Galatia,</hi> and told them of being <hi>removed to another Goſpel,</hi> and to be bewitched, <hi>for not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57559:137"/>the Truth?</hi> Did not he judge them for a Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that did not come from him, that called them? And was not this a Judgment on the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe?</hi> Did not he ſay, <hi>He that troubleth you ſhall bear his Judgment, whoſoever he be?</hi> Did not he Judge <hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> and ſome <hi>for not walking according to the Truth of the Goſpel,</hi> Gal. 2.13, 14.? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> Judge <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> for putting away <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them unto Satan? Was not here a Judgment on the Merit of the Cauſe? And we further Query, Have not they put away Faith and good Conſcience, who <hi>Flee in time of Perſecution, Pay Tythes,</hi> and <hi>Countenance them that do?</hi> Which through Faith, and for a good Conſcience, Friends in the beginning were led to bear Teſtimony againſt?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Obſervation on the aforeſaid Poſition written by the Friends of <hi>Bristol;</hi> and the Reply thereto, is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis impoſſible, that <hi>Queries</hi> can be a <hi>Poſitive Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi> to a <hi>Poſitive Poſition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That whoſoever peruſes the Anſwer of <hi>Briſtol-Friends,</hi> ſhall find, that the words, <hi>Iudgment in ſuch a Caſe,</hi> relates to a Judgment given without a Hearing; for that 'twas impoſſible <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> could be heard in their Caſe, by thoſe before whom they appeared not to ſtate their Caſe: And therefore, if <hi>Queries</hi> might be a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Anſwer,</hi> yet thoſe propoſed as Anſwer, are wholly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent in this Caſe; becauſe, though they ſeem grounded on the Scriptures, to evidence a Judgment on the merit of a Cauſe, yet there is nothing ſaid in all thoſe <hi>Queries</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that ſuch a Judgment on the <hi>Merit</hi> of the Cauſe, was without a <hi>Hearing:</hi> And as to the latter part of the <hi>Queries,</hi> we cannot ſay, That <hi>Fleeing in time of Perſecution,</hi> or <hi>Countenancing Tythe-Payers,</hi> is a <hi>putting away Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Good Conſcience</hi> in all that may ſo do; for that may be the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57559:138"/>Fruit of <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> in ſome, at which God may wink; and of <hi>Unfaithfulneſs</hi> in other-ſome: but whether it hath been the Fruit of <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> or <hi>Unfaithfulneſs</hi> in <hi>G. F.</hi> to be ſo great an Incourager in theſe two Practices (touching which, peruſe the 5th. Part of the <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker</hi>) we will not determine. However, we may conclude, that it muſt be one of them, if ſuch <hi>Practices are contrary</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>to the Teſtimony in the beginning.</hi> For our Conſciences are ſatisfied from ſufficient Evidence, that he hath been largely Guilty in theſe <hi>Two Caſes:</hi> And ſince we have cauſe to believe, he is a <hi>Countenancer</hi> of this kind of Work. 'Tis admired by ſome, that his Party are not more careful, than to bring forth ſuch things, as ſo evidently do caſt a <hi>Line of Reflection</hi> on him, and them the Eſpouſers of that Cauſe, which we may take to be his (and that on ſufficient ground, as from the <hi>Fourth Part of the Chriſtian-Quaker</hi> may appear) and not the Cauſe of Truth, Eſpecially when to reflect on ſuch, as are not guilty thereof, as we take <hi>John Story,</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> to be; not only for that no proof hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the contrary, but alſo from their frequent <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> of their <hi>Innocency</hi> therein.</p>
                     <p>We now come to ſay ſomething in relation to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Poſition, as it relates to <hi>Judging the Merit of the Cauſe without a Hearing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſonableneſs of the ſaid Poſition, plainly appears from the Evidence of the Light within, which teacheth us <hi>to do to others, as we would be done by.</hi> And doubtleſs, ſhould any man accuſe <hi>Jaſper Batt,</hi> (one of theſe that Judged <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> without Hearing them ſpeak for themſelves) that he went abroad Preaching; thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning ſometimes <hi>Twenty Pound</hi> Fines, ſometimes <hi>Forty Pound</hi> Fines, to be impoſed on the Hearers; and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to be <hi>Valiant for the Truth,</hi> and to offer up all (whilſt <hi>His Estate</hi> was well ſecured out of the <hi>Perſecutors
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57559:138"/>Reach,</hi> or at leaſt nothing to be found of his own, to pay ſuch his Fines) he would think <hi>John Story</hi> very ill imployed, to have a hand in giving forth a <hi>Publick Teſtimony</hi> againſt him, to be Read in all the <hi>Monthly</hi> and <hi>Quarterly Meetings</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before he had either Spoken or Written to him, to know what he could Say for himſelf, that he might have Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to huſh it up, by writing a Paper of Condemnation, if ſo be, he were <hi>Guilty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We cannot believe, that <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> hath not done as bad as this, in Signing with the <hi>Sixty Six,</hi> at <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi> his Chamber: And if the Caſe ſtated in his Name, be not groundleſs, 'tis then notoriouſly wicked; but of that, Friends in <hi>Sommerſet-ſhire</hi> are able to ſpeak more certainly, than we; for we are not willing to <hi>Accuſe on Report.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We now are ſenſible, that the ſaid <hi>Jaſper Batt,</hi> and his Three Companions (having aſſumed the place of <hi>Judges</hi>) will not think our Argument deducible from the <hi>Light within,</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to evidence their <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs;</hi> no more, than if they were Four <hi>Blind Prieſts,</hi> who neglecting the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gift in themſelves, may ſeek a Juſtification of their <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Juriſdiction, from the Scriptures without: And therefore, we think it needful to obſerve, ſomewhat from the Scriptures of Truth, in relation to the Matter in hand. <hi>John</hi> 5.22. 'tis ſaid: <hi>For the Father judgeth no Man, but committeth all Judgment to the Son.</hi> Now, let us conſider what the Son ſaith, <hi>Verſe</hi> the 30th. of the ſame <hi>Chapter, Chriſt</hi> the Son ſaith: <hi>I can of my Self do nothing; as I Hear, I Judge; and my Judgment is Just, becauſe I ſeek not mine own Will.</hi> We may now query, Whether <hi>God</hi> hath given unto <hi>Jaſper Batt,</hi> and the Reſt, <hi>who have <hi>Iudged</hi> without a <hi>Hearing,</hi>
                        </hi> a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and larger Commiſſion as Judges, than to <hi>Christ,</hi> who informs us, <hi>That as he Heard, he Judged?</hi> And, Whether amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> more Juſtice was not offered to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when in his Favour 'twas ſaid by <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> John 7.31. <hi>Doth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57559:139"/>our Law Judge any Man, before it hear him?</hi> Beſides, we find <hi>Chriſt</hi> exhorting his Diſciples, Math. 7.1. <hi>Judge not, that ye be not Judged.</hi> Rom. 14.10. <hi>But, Why doſt thou Judge thy Brother? Why doſt thou ſet at Nought thy Brother?</hi> Had theſe Scriptures been rightly applyed, we firmly believe, <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> and others would not have been found Judging, and ſetting at Nought two ſuch <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Honourable</hi> Labourers in the Goſpel, as <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> have approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps, <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> may tell us, <hi>That we are Unlearned, and do wreſt the Scriptures; and that</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and his Apoſtles did not mean, but that ſuch Men as he, might Judge ſuch Men as</hi> John Story <hi>and</hi> John Wilkinſon <hi>are, without a Hearing:</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as a Reaſon, may thus ſay; <hi>Though the</hi> Lord <hi>was pleaſed to ſend them forth, Commiſſionating them to Publiſh the Goſpel of</hi> Chriſt,, <hi>and that in that Service they have been made Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to gather many into the Knowledge, and Life of</hi> Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>Yet they are not now ſubject to <hi>George Fox</hi> his <hi>Orders,</hi> and what he hath given forth in the Motion of the Spirit of</hi> God.</p>
                     <p>If this <hi>Objection</hi> contains the Senſe of <hi>Jaſper Batt,</hi> with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Submiſſion to <hi>G.

                           <p>We now come to take notice of theſe Words in the afore recited Anſwer, given forth by <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> and his three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; <hi>viz.

                           </p>
                           <p>To this we ſay, They would have manifeſted more plainneſs, and ſimplicity, if they had <hi>informed</hi> thoſe unto whom they writ, How to apply theſe Scriptures, inſtead of bidding them, <hi>Read the Scriptures, and then rightly apply them.</hi> For the great Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, what is meant by words, <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Dignities:</hi> but ſince they are ſilent therein, it's rational for us to ſuppoſe on the whole matter, that they mean the <hi>Sixty Six Subſcribes</hi> whereof they are a part, ſince the paper ſubſcribed by them, in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal matter, occaſioning this diſcourſe, and according to its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſufficiently deſpiſed.</p>
                           <p>And therefore, we think it needful to inform the <hi>Reader,</hi> That we cannot take ſuch Men, as <hi>Jaſper Batt,</hi> and his Three Brethren are, (nor yet <hi>Charles Marſhall,</hi> Subſcriber alſo amongſt the <hi>Sixty-Six</hi>)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57559:140"/>to be the <hi>Dignities</hi> hinted at by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude.</hi> For all theſe, and the reſt of the <hi>Sixty-Six Subſcribers,</hi> are by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per manifeſt, to have run in the very Way of <hi>Cain,</hi> by perſecuting the Brethren; and have appeared, as <hi>Raging Waves</hi> of the Sea, foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their own Shame, by their hard Speeches, which are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Marks,</hi> and Fruits of thoſe, who deſpiſe <hi>Government,</hi> according to the Scriptures, which <hi>Jaſper Batt,</hi> and his Three Brethren have directed us to peruſe.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, We doubt not but many of the ſaid <hi>Sixty-Six Subſcribers, ſpeak Evill of the things they know not, having Mens Perſons in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, becauſe of Advantage;</hi> which are ſome other Marks of ſuch as Deſpiſed <hi>Government,</hi> and ſpeak Evil of <hi>Dignities.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thoſe things we leave to the Conſideration of the impartial <hi>Reader;</hi> hoping, that for the future, <hi>Jaſper Batt</hi> will learn more modeſty, than to account himſelf a <hi>Governour,</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> and that on that foot, he may think to rule over ſuch antient and honourable Labourers in the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted themſelves to be; whereof this Nation yields many <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving witneſſes.</hi>

                  <p>MANIFESTING, That there is but two ſorts of Government owned by the Children of Light, or <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker.</hi> One is, The <hi>Outward Government,</hi> under which we Live, unto the Laws whereof we owe either Active or Paſſive Obedience, and ought not by Outward Force to endeavour Deliverance from under ſuch Laws as we have or may term Oppreſſive.</p>
                  <p>The other is, the <hi>Inward Government of Chriſt</hi> (who alone is <hi>LORD,</hi> over the <hi>Conſcience</hi>) which is not repreſented by perſons (viſible by carnal eyes) inveſted with Power from him to execute outward Laws, Preſcriptions, Orders, Edicts, or Decrees in an outward Form of Government, viſible, as aforeſaid.</p>

                  <p>To which is added a Letter Written (as is pretended) by <hi>W. R.</hi> but Publiſhed by <hi>R. B.</hi> together with a Paper termed, <hi>The Judgment of the Brethren,</hi> in a Diſcourſe had between <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>W. R.</hi> with Obſervations and Anſwer thereto.</p>

                  <head>The THIRD PART OF THE Chriſtian-Quaker Diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Apoſtate and Innovator,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>THere are but two ſorts of <hi>Government</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every Chriſtian to own; The one is <hi>Outward,</hi> the other <hi>Inward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Outward Government</hi> is repreſented by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Perſons, inveſted with Power to execute Outward Laws, viſible by our carnal Eyes, and is ſuffered by Almighty God, to be executed under variety of Forms, and diverſitie of Laws, and for divers ends, which we do not now pretend to be reveal'd to us; but yet we believe it to be our duty either <hi>actively</hi> or <hi>paſſively</hi> to ſubmit unto the <hi>Outward Government,</hi> under which we live, without deſigning to work our own deliverance (from under ſuch Laws which we have or may account oppreſſive) by outward Force or Violence, which is as much as is with us to ſay on this occaſion, with reſpect to <hi>Outward Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Inward Government</hi> chiefly deſigned to be treated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, the <hi>Government of Chriſt,</hi> which we do not believe to be repreſented by viſible perſons, certainly known by outward Names, diſtinguiſh'd by outward marks and tokens, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57559:142"/>with Power from him to execute <hi>Outward Laws,</hi> in an Outward Form of Government, viſible by our Carnal Eyes, as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>That the Government of Chriſt is an <hi>Inward Government,</hi> is evident from the words of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah; Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33. <hi>I will make a New Covenant with the houſe of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>&amp;c. not according to the Covenant that I made with your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>After thoſe days, I will put my Law in their Inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and they ſhall teach no more every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This we believe was ſpoken with reſpect to the Reign of Chriſt, by his Spirit in the Hearts of the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men, and clearly ſhews, <hi>that the Laws of Chriſt's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, under the new Covenant, are written in the Hearts of his People,</hi> and therefore an <hi>Inward Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection,</hi> But if any ſhall object, <hi>That the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet relate not to thoſe, who are of the Gentile Stock, of which Stock, according to the Fleſh, it may be ſaid, that we are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We thereto ſay, That the words of <hi>Paul</hi> do effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that Objection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. <hi>There is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the</hi> Jew <hi>and the</hi> Gentile; <hi>for the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him,</hi> Col. 3.9, 10, 11. <hi>Lie not one to another, ſeeing that you have put off the Old Man with his deeds, and have put on the New Man, which is renewed in Knowledge after the Image of him that created him, where there is neither</hi> Gentile <hi>nor</hi> Jew, <hi>Circumciſion nor Uncircumciſion,</hi> Barbarian, Scythian, <hi>Bond nor Free; but Chriſt is all, and in all.</hi> Many other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both out of the Prophets and Apoſtles Writings, might be quoted to evidence the matter intended.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57559:142"/>
                  <p>We are yet ſenſible that this further Objection may be raiſed, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Objection, <hi>That neither the words of the Prophet, nor of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, cited by us, make mention of Government over</hi> Jew <hi>or</hi> Gentile, <hi>but doth ſhew (as from the ſcope of the Scripture appears) that the Apoſtle ſo writ to convince the</hi> Jews <hi>of the difference between the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and that of Faith, and to ſhew unto Believers</hi> (<hi>whether</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gentiles) <hi>that though ſome might appear in a Voluntary Humility Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Angels, intrude into thoſe things they had not ſeen, and be vainly puffed up in their fleſhly minds, and not give all Obedience unto the Head Chriſt, through whom alone there is an increaſe in the increaſes of God; yet they were therein reproveable, as not being riſen with Chriſt; and further alſo to ſhew that thoſe who were dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the world, ought not to be ſubject to (nor yet to touch, taſte or handle) ſuch Ordinances, as were after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Objection</hi> we anſwer, That though the word <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is not expreſsly mentioned; yet there are words in what is cited out of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> importing the three ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> viz. <hi>A Lawgiver, the Place where the Law is to be found written, and the People for whom it is given.</hi> Beſides, from theſe words of <hi>Paul,</hi> viz. <hi>The ſame Lord over all,</hi> a Governour is implied, <hi>viz. Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> and ſo conſequently, a Government over that All. And from what hereafter follows, it will appear, that the End of this Government is to lead into all Truth.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it leades us to obſerve, That there are divers true Marks, whereby the <hi>Oppoſers</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Government</hi> may be diſtinguiſht.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are ſuch as are in a Voluntary Humility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such as Worſhip Angels, which may reaſonably
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57559:143"/>be taken to be a <hi>Worſhipping of ſome Meſſengers, whom God hath ſent,</hi> becauſe the ſignification of the word <hi>Angel,</hi> is <hi>a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such as intrude into thoſe things they have not ſeen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Such as are puft up in their fleſhly minds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Such as give not all obedience unto the head Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Such as are Subject to Ordinances after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men. And to be very plain for the clearing the Truth, we muſt give this our Teſtimony; that we are really perſwaded from what our Eyes &amp; Ears have been witneſſes, that many of thoſe amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have Zealouſly contended for the Obſervation of Outward Rules and Orders, given forth by One Man, bear all the aforeſaid <hi>Marks:</hi> for whoſoever they are that pretend Zeal to promote, ſubmit unto, and exerciſe themſelves in other mens lines made ready to their hands, and that on a pretended religious ſcore, when thorow the word of true Faith, they ſee it not their duty, or if they ſhall pretend they do, and thereupon ſtrive to enforce others to ſubmit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (there being no ground from the Scripture of Truth, or Light of Chriſt ſo to ſtrive) it naturaly follows, that the aforeſaid Marks accompany ſuch: and this we confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that thorough the whole Scriptures of Truth there is not one word from whence we may rationally expect, (and that according to the meaning of the Spirit) that Chriſt hath or will Commiſſionate any One Man, or Men, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Outward Rules and Orders, relating to Faith or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in the Church, to be binding on the Conſciences of the Subjects, of his Kingdom; whether they ſhould ſee it to be their duty, from the Law written in their hearts, or no.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if we conſider the nature of Chriſt's Kingdom and Government, it will appear to be ſuch unto which outward written Laws, viſible by our carnal eyes, and to be executed by periſhing objects, according to an outward Magiſtratical; or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57559:143"/>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, are wholly unſutable; becauſ Chriſts Kingdom is not of this world, but is an Everlaſting Kingdom; and therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>That of the encreaſe of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there ſhall be no end,</hi> and though <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Chap. 11. V. 15. gives this Teſtimony, <hi>That there were great voices in heaven, ſaying, the Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt. And he ſhall Reign forever and ever</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.11.) yet there is nothing ſaid to ſignify that the manner of his Reign was or ſhould be otherwiſe then as before is deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if any Man or Men have or may pretend him, or themſelves to be ſuch on Earth, on whom the weight of Chriſts Government (which is Spiritual) is laid, it is not like to have any Evidence in our Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Not only becauſe we find no ſuch Prophecy, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Scriptures of Truth; but alſo for that we rather find the contrary; for in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. 'tis thus ſaid, <hi>And the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders, and his Name ſhall be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wonderful Councellor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe 'tis wholly repugnant to the Light of Chriſt in our Conſciences, that the weight of a Government that is Spiritual and Everlaſting (the Laws whereof are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Heart) and wherein nothing but true Judgment and Juſtice hath been, is, and ſhall be executed for evermore, ſhould reſt upon any Man or Men, as a Governour or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours over others; ſince there is no Man, nor Men but are ſubject through Temptation to Err, if they watch not; and therefore we may well ſay, much leſs on any ſuch one man (though termed by ſome the great Apoſtle of Chriſt) whoſe Actions towards his Brethren have been found injurious to them undeſervedly, and reproachful to the Truth: nor yet upon any ſuch Aſſemblies, as the uſual <hi>General Meeting</hi> (ſo termed though improperly) of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> is, becauſe the Meeters have uſually conſiſted of Uncertain Numbers, of Uncertain Qualifyed Perſons, that take upon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57559:144"/>them ſo to aſſemble, whileſt others beholding the Ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their Meeting, conſcientiouſly forbear to joyn with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe it is evident that the Diſciples of Chriſt had their Eye ſo much on his outward and bodily appearance as that Chriſt their Lord and Maſter ſaw it meet to tell them in theſe words; <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7. <hi>It is expedient for you, that I go away;</hi> and when he ſo ſaid, he did not then tell them (nor yet at any time before or after) I will commiſſionate ſome Man, or Aſſembly of Men in my Stead, that ſo you may have your Eye unto (and expect Written Orders from) him, or them to walk by, and to lead you into all Truth; but <hi>John</hi> gives them a Reaſon for his ſo ſaying (in theſe words; <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7.) <hi>For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come; but if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, I will ſend him unto you</hi> (meaning the Spirit of Truth) <hi>which</hi> (as he promiſed) <hi>ſhould abide with them for ever, and ſhould be in them;</hi> which undoubtedly was in order to the Exaltation of his Government in the Heart, and that they might have their whole Dependency on the Spirit of Truth, which (as before is ſignifyed) Chriſt promiſed ſhould abide with them forever. And ſo this may truly be termed that Everlaſting, Unerring, Unchangable Governour, unto which the Subjects of Chriſt's Kingdom owe Obedience; And, <hi>why ſo?</hi> but becauſe under it the Promiſe of Chriſt was, <hi>That they ſhould be guided into all Truth,</hi> according as is plainly ſignifyed from theſe following words ſpoken by Chriſt himſelf; <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. <hi>I have yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear them now; Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf: But whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak.</hi> Here is no room left for the Church of Chriſt to contend about Forms of Government, or who ſhall be Governours, under Chriſt's Government; for if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is in us, and that is to remain with us forever, ſhall guide us into all Truth, then our Dependency ought to be thereon; that ſo thereby we may be led into all Truth, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57559:144"/>elſe we cannot manifeſt our ſelves to be obedient Subjects unto Chriſt, under his Government, that he is exalting in the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Men. The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things leads us to give this Teſtimony; That there is no ground either from the Scriptures of Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, or Light of Chriſt within us, to believe that any Chriſtian Profeſſour can in Truth affirm; <hi>That there are Outward Preſcriptions and Orders given forth by the Spirit of God, through any one or more Mortal Men in this our Day, which others ought to obey, and follow</hi> (of which more anon in anſwer to R.B's Book of Government) <hi>whether they ſee it their Duty or no; and if they do not, may therefore come under the Curſe, and partake of the ſame Judgments from God, which happened to</hi> Corah, Dathan <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>for their Rebellion againſt</hi> Moſes; <hi>and though the ſin of</hi> Corah, &amp;c. <hi>hath frequently in our Publick Meetings for Worſhip, been ſpoken of and intended (as we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it) to be as a proper Citation to deſcribe the ſtate of ſuch as on a Conſcientious ſcore cannot ſubmit unto the outward Orders of one man, yet we teſtify, that ſuch ſort of inſinuating and thretning lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſeems much more agreeable to the firſt Covenant then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, under which we are; and when countenanced, or ſpoken by any, expecting ſuch a ſubmiſſion, it then ſeems to ſavour of a ſpirit that ſpeaketh of himſelf, and not what he hath heard from the great Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt: and ſo conſequently from another ſpirit than that which Chriſt promiſed he would ſend, for Chriſt's own words ſignify, He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, tis evident that <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company rebelled againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was King in <hi>Jeſuran</hi> and a Leader of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thorough whom the Lord gave forth his Law to the People; but we know that none can according to truth, at this Day, pretend that any other Governour is raiſed up amongſt the Children of Light, to be like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom we ought to hear in all things, ſave Chriſt Jeſus, who by his Spirit manifeſted in every Subject of his Kingdom, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become their Lawgiver, and whileſt they are obedient thereunto, they may in truth be reckoned to be of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57559:145"/>number of thoſe, that are in Chriſt Jeſus; becauſe they may then truly be termed <hi>ſuch as walk not after the fleſh, but the ſpirit, and to ſuch</hi> (according to the Apoſtles Doctrine) <hi>there is no Condemnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> This Diſcourſe touching <hi>Government,</hi> may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſome to raiſe this Objection; <hi>We underſtand that many called</hi> Quakers, <hi>do hold Monthly and Quarterly-Meetings of Men, and alſo of Women, diſtinct from Men, about their Church Affairs; and that theſe Meetings are reputed to be Eſtabliſhed (on certain dayes that ought not to be altered) by one man amongſt them, that hath pretended, he was moved of God ſo to do; and that the ſame perſon hath by his Paper ſpread abroad in divers parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſignified, that none but looſe ſpirits, and ſuch as tend to looſeneſs, pretend to ſet up a better way, or to alter them to another day, for fear of Corruption in Obſerving a Day; and that it is but from a corrupt ſpirit of darkneſs, which God will blaſt; and that ſome call theſe Meetings the Government of Chriſt ſet up amongſt them, and eſtabliſh't by the power of God, to take care of the Churches affairs; and that true Judgment and Juſtice, which are the fruits of Chriſt's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, may be executed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer, we confeſſe there have been and yet may be, ſuch Meetings; but if any think they have been, or are eſtabliſh't by any one man, or that therein the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt</hi> is ſet up, any otherwiſe than as any Member or Members of the Church may be Witneſſes thereof in their Own Hearts, we are ſorry for ſuch weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>However it gives us occaſion to add this Teſtimony, That if we conſult the Scriptures of Truth, and Light of Chriſt, we have no Ground to believe, that under the diſpenſation of the <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> God hath, or ever will move by his Spirit in any Mortal Man or Men, to take upon him or them, ſo to appoint certain dayes, for others to meet upon, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the outward Affairs of a Chriſtian Society, as that if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57559:145"/>any of that Society aſſent not thereto, or endeavour to alter them to another day, then ſuch may be Juſtly cenſured as men of looſe Spirits, or led by a corrupt Spirit of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for every Member of ſuch a Society, ought firſt to be fully perſwaded in their own minds, in all things relating to Faith or Diſcipline; and not to be Judging one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing wherein they may differ, when the matter it ſelf ſprings from a Conſcientious Scruple, and not Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy contrary to Knowledge; for from the Holy Scriptures we learn, that <hi>that which is not of faith is ſin;</hi> and that <hi>there was the Day of Ignorance accompanyed ſome, at which the Lord Winked.</hi> And yet (to our Greif) we may ſay, that ſuch a <hi>Day of gloomineſs</hi> and <hi>thick Darkneſs,</hi> hath overtaken ſome amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who appear zealous for ſome Outward Forms of Diſcipline, which they (as we take it) foolliſhly imagin are eſtabliſh't as by a <hi>Decree from Heaven,</hi> that they ſeem to make void the Law of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and humane Society; and as if their Religion were moſt Effectually demonſtrated, by appearing in ſuch a kind of Spirit, that Chriſt reproved in his Diſciples, when they asked him on this wiſe, <hi>Wilt thou that we Command Fire to come down from Heaven and conſume them,</hi> meaning the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that did not receive Chriſt, becauſe his Face was, as though he would go to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To return again, we farther ſay, That whoever hath given Occaſion for ſuch an <hi>Objection</hi> to be raiſed, as aforeſaid, 'tis to be doubted it ſprange from one that aſpires to give Rules to others, whileſt he will not be ſubject to the ſame himſelf; for if it were not ſo, its very probable we might have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped the ſevere judgment of being guilty of <hi>Corahs</hi> ſin, and that only becauſe we have endeavoured to convince ſome, that that
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Namely, G. F.</hi>
                     </note> one Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the <hi>Objection,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See the fourth and fifth Parts of the</hi> Chriſtian-Quaker.</note> hath acted contrary to the outward Rules and Orders that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath preſcribed for others to walk by.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57559:146"/>
                  <p>As to the word <hi>Eſtabliſh't,</hi> we further add, That the word (as uſed in the <hi>Objection</hi>) is diſowned by us; for though the Children of God may be Inſtruments in the hand of the Lord, to eſtabliſh one another in the Faith of God's Elect, yet 'tis not in their power, or of any one of them, poſitively and without exception, to eſtabliſh what ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and practiced, whether it reſpect Doctrine, or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: and if any one or more have atempted ſo to do, it may Juſtly be ſaid of ſuch, that he or they have endeavoured to invade Chriſt's Prerogative.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we obſerve, That the <hi>Objection</hi> is made with reſpect to one man, which to us ſeems as if in the <hi>Objectors</hi> ſenſe, that one man amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> had Power given him of God to eſtabliſh an Outward Form, wherein all God's People ought to walk (or elſe ſeverely to be cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Rebellion) whether they ſee it their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Duty or not: but this we deny, as that which may Juſtly be termed an Abomination, either ſo to endeavour, or ſo to ſubmit. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> If we enquire, <hi>what is eſtabliſh't?</hi> we know, if any Anſwer be given to what by the Queſtion we intend, it will be on this wiſe, <hi>Certain Meetings to be held by the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>or at leaſt ſome of them, on certain prefixt dayes.</hi> But if we ask, <hi>Who are the Meeters, that are to make up the eſtabliſh't Meetings?</hi> none can give ſuch a certain Diſcription, as, that the Meeters may be certainly known; and therefore the uſe of the word <hi>Eſtabliſh't,</hi> applicable to outward Societies of People, ſo uncertain to be known, or outwardly deſcribable, ſeems to us vain and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>By this diſcourſe the Reader may gather, that we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from owning thoſe Meetings (mentioned in the laſt <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> to be <hi>eſtabliſh'd</hi>) as a part of Chriſt's Government, and as to their having any ſhare as a <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 'twill be time enough for us to anſwer when any ſhall pretend, that they have manifeſted, <hi>that thoſe uncertain quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed Perſons, uſually Aſſembled in ſuch Meetings, were then Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57559:146"/>of the Church of Chriſt, and that as Members thereof, they had right to ſtile themſelves, Church-Governours.</hi> However, we think it needful to ſignify, That the chief Ends (as we underſtood) wherefore the ſaid Meetings were aſſented to by many Friends, were to relieve the Poor, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form other neceſſary Services relating to the Truth, and Friends concerned therein, in which we thought our ſelves (and doubtleſs all the Faithful with us) Servants one unto another, and not Maſters, Governours, or Rulers over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for that did not ſo much as enter into our Hearts: But when we perceived that ſome Upſtarts (that to us ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love Preheminence, as <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did) lookt upon themſelves, as Somebody, from their appearing (and being encouraged to appear) Members in ſuch Meetings, and to lay <hi>a ſtreſs</hi> on the prefixt Dayes for Meeting; affirming, that <hi>they were Eſtabliſhed by the Power of God, that Friends who were Heirs of the Power, might come and take their Poſſeſſions therein;</hi> (a ſort of Language not well underſtood by ſuch as are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Wiſdom from above) then many Friends began to ſtartle thereat, fearing that ſome (through Weakneſs and Blind Zeal) would Idolize the ſame, and run into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable Form, and endeavour to bite and devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about Outward Things; and ſo at length ſome Friends in Truth, moved to alter the Days of Meeting in ſome places, but others not aſſenting thereto, Contention aroſe, and a Fire hath been kindled about Church-Government, at ſo high a rate, as that Publick Meeting Places, for the Worſhip of God, have ſometimes become meer Stages of Contention; and other times the <hi>keeping on of Hats in Prayer</hi> by ſome, whileſt others have been uncovered, hath become as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of diviſions; the knowledge whereof being no longer to be hid, hath more vigorouſly occaſioned the bringing forth of our <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> Intituled <hi>the Chriſtian-Quaker, diſtinguiſhed from the Apoſtate and Innovator, in five Parts</hi> (whereof this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> touching <hi>Government,</hi> is one) that ſo all may now know, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57559:147"/>Darkneſs is not ſo overſhadowed, but that the Lord hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a Remnant amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that cannot bow their Knee to any Image or Image-Maker; nor yet to acknowledge, that Salvation is attainable through Faith in any other Name, than the Name of Jeſus, who is given of the Father to be Salvation to the Ends of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>I now come to give the Reader a perticular Account of ſome Aſſertions and Scripture Quotations, relating to <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> amongſt one part of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Print by <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> together with Anſwers thereto, contained in a <hi>Manuſcript</hi> given forth by my ſelf, who was concerned in my Conſcience ſo to do, for the ſakes of ſuch, as being weak, are apt to be precipitated into a Zealous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of other mens Lines made ready to their hands, when not led thereinto by a Meaſure of Gods Gift and Grace in themſelves; and ſo may juſtly be termed like unto thoſe, who render <hi>for Doctrine the Traditions of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The aforeſaid Aſſertions, Quotations, and particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers thereto (ſome Years paſt, ſent to <hi>Steven Criſp</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick Perſon, as well as the Author of the ſaid Book) doth follow, as proper in relation to this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> touching <hi>Government;</hi> and if the Reader ſhall find any thing therein, which hath been herein already treated upon, or in the firſt part of the <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker, diſtinguiſh'd from the Apoſtate and Innovator,</hi> I hope he will not be offended thereat, ſince the enſuing Lines were written on a Particular Occaſion, though of a General Concern, relating to the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and that alſo before it was deſigned, that the ſaid firſt part ſhould be prepared, much leſs committed to the Preſs: However, that which may well plead my Excuſe for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Expence of Time on ſuch an Occaſion, is this, There is very little Diſcourſe of which hath been mentioned before, and that which is, is very material to be obſerved, as a proper Looking-Glaſs in ſome reſpect, to diſtinguiſh the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> (termed in Deriſion, <hi>Quaker</hi>) from the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> and <hi>Innovator.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57559:149"/>or diſ-believing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet there is amongst them, who hath endeavoured to inſinuate a Belief, that the Church in matters of Conſcience may not only give poſitive Sentences, which may be Obligatory upon Believers; but alſo, that the Pretences of any refuſing to ſubmit on account they ſee it not, will not excuſe them from being really guilty of diſobeying God; and yet doth not manifeſt by any outward Deſcription, <hi>Where, or What Aſſembly, is the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, though I cannot vindicate the Author of the ſaid Treatiſe, from giving occaſion of theſe and ſuch like Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, yet I know there are many of thoſe People yet in being, whoſe Integrity to God is ſo great, whoſe Steadfaſtneſs in the Unchangable Truth is ſo ſure, and whoſe Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, in the pure Principle thereof are ſo clear, that they give not occaſion for ſuch Jealouſies, but have a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in their Hearts againſt all ſuch that do; knowing this, that whoſoever builds on any other Foundation, than that which hath been already laid, viz. <hi>Chriſt the Lord</hi> (to whom all Power is given to Rule and Reign, and who alone is <hi>Lord</hi> over the <hi>Conſcience</hi> and the only <hi>Law-giver</hi>) ſhall be confounded, and brought to nought.</p>

                  <head>The matters occaſionally diſcourſt in this enſuing Treatiſe, are in ſome meaſure deſcribed in what followes.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Affirm, that though there hath been, and ought to be a Government in the Church of Chriſt, unto which every Member of the ſaid Church ought to be ſubject, yet it doth not appear, that the Outward Form thereof, and all Matters cognizable thereby, are ſo exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Scriptures or elſe where, as that the Members thereof by any ſuch outward Deſcription (as a ſufficient meanes) may ſo exactly be exerciſed therein, as to find accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Lord of Life: That at this day nothing can be truly called the Exact and perfect Order of this Government but the Power of God (and ſo hath it often been teſtifyed by the People of the Lord called <hi>Quakers</hi>) which <hi>power is of Ability to eſtabliſh Man,</hi> but <hi>Man not of Ability to eſtabliſh it;</hi> and that the Power brings forth its own Form in every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, according to the meaſure of God's Grace inwardly given, received and obeyed; and yet I am abundantly ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Set and Appointed Meetings on certain Prefixt Days, being with the joynt concurrence of thoſe Members aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and from time to time to be aſſembled, to <hi>take care of the Poor,</hi> and <hi>diſcharge other charitable Duties; to inſpect Marriages, that none come together diſorderly;</hi> and <hi>to take care that Truth may not be Scandlized through the Backſlidings of ſuch, who have been in fellowſhip with the Children of Light,</hi> are not inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with that form that the Power of God may lead into. For I am a Witneſs, for many years paſt, even to this day, that ſuch Meetings have been ſerviceable to anſwer thoſe Righteous Ends. But if the Members of any ſuch Meetings, ſhall by their Practices therein, not only aſſume (as ſome there are, who to my Knowledge have too manifeſtly ſo done) but continue to aſſume <hi>another place</hi> in the Body, than that wherein God hath placed them, or ſhall endeavour, ſo to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57559:150"/>eſtabliſh Outward Indiſpenſible Rules and Orders therein relating to Conſcience, as that ſuch of the Brethren, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not thereunto, ſhall be accounted not of the Body, though they ſee it not their Duty; it may be Juſt with the Lord (as a token of his Indignation and Diſpleaſure) to withdraw his refreſhing Preſence from ſuch Aſſemblies, and then their Meetings may become as uſeleſs, as a Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Spirit, is But yet;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> undertakes to deſcribe the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>how far it extends;</hi> and alſo teſtifies, <hi>the Antient Apoſtolick Order of the Church of Chriſt is Re-eſtabliſht amongst the People of the Lord called</hi> Quakers. Notwithſtanding which his ſaying, I Affirm, they are in the Practice of many things, with reſpect to Church-diſcipline, wherein the Scriptures, treating of thoſe things, given forth by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, are ſilent; and are not found in the Practice of ſome other things, which were either practiſed, exhorted to, or commanded by the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Affirm, that as Chriſt's Kingdom is not of this World, ſo the Members of Chriſt's Church have not Power in Caſes of Difference, ariſing amongſt themſelves, touching out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, to aſſume Juriſdiction over the Properties, and Worldly Concerns each of other, when not choſen for that Service by the Conſent of the Members Differing; and yet I do ſay, 'tis the duty of fellow-members, that are at variance, to refer by mutual choice their Cauſe unto other Brethren. But Yet;</p>
                  <p>R. B. ſaith, <hi>As a People gathered together by the Lord, unto the ſame Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that we have Power and Authority to decide and remove theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I Affirm, That nothing can become a Right and <hi>Chriſtian Bond</hi> upon Believers, to be Exerciſed in any practical duty, relating to the things of God, and Matters
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57559:150"/>of Conſcience, until convinced by the Witneſs of God in their Conſciences of the ſervice thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Belief of Certain Principles and Doctines, (though believed through the force of Truth on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) and Practices depending thereon, are not the very <hi>Bond</hi> by which the People of the Lord, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> are become centered into the Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Body, nor yet the <hi>Cauſe</hi> that gather'd them; but the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Bond,</hi> and in the beſt ſenſe ſuch Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Bond,</hi> and the <hi>Cauſe</hi> that gathered them was <hi>Gods Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Sentence and Judgment of any man or men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, relating to Matters of Conſcience, ought not at this day to be given forth, but by way of Recomendation to every mans conſcience in the Sight of God; and that when the Conſcience is ſenſible, that Gods Witneſs therein doth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereto, then the Conſcience is <hi>bound,</hi> and not before. But Yet;</p>
                  <p>R. B. tells us, <hi>That Principles and Doctrines believed, thorough the Force of Truth on the Underſtanding, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neceſſarily depending thereon, are the Terms that have drawn us together, and the very</hi> Bond <hi>by which we became center<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one Body and Fellowſhip, or are linked to the Body, and the Cauſe that gathered us;</hi> as in his Treatiſe, Page 48, 49, may appear. And whether in <hi>R. B</hi>'s. Senſe the Centure of a part of Chriſt's Body, ought not to become a Bond on all the Members, and that in Caſes of Conſcience too. I refer the Reader to peruſe his ſixth Section.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> I Affirm, That the Qualification of a Member of Chriſt's Body, is Sanctification through the Spirit, that where any number of ſuch are aſſembled together in Chriſt's name, though but of the leſſer Rank in the Body, there is the Church of Chriſt; that before ſuch an Aſſembly, Caſes of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57559:151"/>Differences may be brought, which may be beſides the Gift or Capacity of ſuch to determin and Judge; and therefore infallible Judgment (which is unalterably ſeated in the Spirit) in ſome caſes may be wanting to appear through any one Member in ſuch Aſſemblies, as properly may be called the Church of Chriſt. But yet; R. B. ſaith in his <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> Page 68. <hi>That there never will, nor can be wanting in Caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, the Spirit of God to give Judgment thorow ſome or other in the Church of Chriſt, ſo long as any Aſſembly can properly, or in any tollerable ſuppoſition be ſo termed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly.</hi> Since 'tis commonly reputed, that none but <hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend Tradition to Juſtify their Actions, wherein the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent, and that we have no Preſident in the Scriptures, that the Apoſtles and Elders, under the Notion of the Church of Chriſt, did take upon them to determin Controverſies, ariſing amongſt the Apoſtles and Elders in the Church of Chriſt, touching Caſes of Conſcience, without the aſſent of the Differing Parties, who (eſpecially if Equals, and once at Unity, and their Caſes Matters of Conſcience, ariſing from occaſional differing Senſe, and Judgment) have by the Law of Divine Nature <hi>Equal Right to nominate a part of thoſe who ſhall have the hearing of ſuch Caſes:</hi> Therefore I affirm, if any ſhall without the aſſent of ſuch Partyes differing, take upon them to be a <hi>bond,</hi> that the differing Partyes muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſuch their Caſe to their diciſive ſentence, and accordingly ſubmit, and be ſubject, though they are not clear in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo to do; ſuch do Juſtly ſubject themſelves to the cenſure of being Impoſers and Uſurpers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That ſubmiſſion to the poſitive ſentences of others touching matters of conſcience (though ſuppoſing themſelves the Church of Chriſt) before the conſcience is convinc'd by God's Witneſs therein, is an abuſe to the Profeſſion of Truth, an antient mark of Apoſtacy, and an infallible token
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57559:151"/>that ſuch who ſo ſubmit have no inward ſenſe, that they are led thereunto by the Spirit of the Lord; but notwithſtanding theſe two laſt particulars are evidently true, yet whoſoever reads what R. B. hath aſſerted, in Page 68. may find, that according to his Lines, and Aſſertions, this ſhort enſuing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may be collected, without the leaſt abuſe of his words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That any ones not ſubmitting to the poſitive Judgment touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Controverſy given by any Aſſembly, or at leaſt by ſome or other of them which may in any tollerable ſuppoſition be termed the Church of Chriſt, is diſobedience to God, though the perſons refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, pretend they refuſe on the account they ſee it not.</hi>

                  <head>The <hi>Innovations</hi> and <hi>Scripture-Miſapplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>R. B.</hi> Detected.</head>
                  <p>I Shall begin with the Title Page, wherein <hi>R. B.</hi> thus ſaith, <hi>So is alſo the Antient Apoſtolick Order of the Church of Chriſt Re-eſtabliſhed, and ſettled on its right Baſis and Foundation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I thus ſay: This kind of Language with reſpect to divers Practices in Diſcipline amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> or any outward Form and Order, which is, or hath been by any called the <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> I do not underſtand to be rightly applicable to thoſe amongſt the ſaid People, who have retained their firſt Love to, and Savour of the Truth, and right Underſtanding of the Principle thereof; not that I would hereby be underſtood, that its not neceſſary to be in the Exerciſe of Outward Order, with reſpect to that Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcipline, which becomes the Church of Chriſt; but that which I underſtand not to be rightly applicable unto them, is manifeſted in what follows.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57559:152"/>
                  <p>Though the principle of Truth in theſe latter dayes hath, and may further lead into the Practice of Outward Order in Diſcipline, with relation to the Church of Chriſt; yet I affirm, that part of that Outward Order in Diſcipline, wherein divers of the People of the Lord called <hi>Quakers</hi> have been acted, is ſuch, as that there is not the leaſt Footſteps thereof to be found in the Scriptures, as exhorted to, or as practiſed by the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> I could give many Inſtances hereof, but one ſhall ſuffice, <hi>viz. The Form of Proceedings in Marriages, wherein the Scriptures are wholly ſilent, as to the Primitive</hi> Chriſtians; and tho the <hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend to Tradition, yet the People of the Lord called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do not. Beſides, 'tis evident by the Scriptures of Truth, that the Apoſtles were found in the Practice of that, which the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do not only out of Conſcience to God forbear, but have had many Conteſts with others touching the ſame, as eſteeming it (though permitted for a ſeaſon, by reaſon of the Weakneſs of the People) amongſt the number of thoſe Outward Ordinances, out of which the Lord hath at this day gathered his People; witneſs <hi>Water-Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>[Order]</hi> with reſpect to Outward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Eſtabliſh't by the Church of Chriſt over it ſelf, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not in the Scriptures of Truth; yet much of late is ſpoken of the <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> and of <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> the ſame, and that with reſpect to Outward Preſcriptions and Orders practiſed, or endeavoured to be introduced amongſt the People of the Lord, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and in perticular, R. B. Page 40. ſpeaks of the <hi>Truth and Faith we have been, and are in the Lords Hands building up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I ſay, The Conſideration that Chriſt is the Truth, and the great Power of God; and that an <hi>Eſtabliſhing in the Faith,</hi> cannot Properly be termed <hi>A building up of Faith,</hi> gives me occaſion to treat a little touching the words, <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> and <hi>build up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57559:152"/>
                  <p>We know from the teſtimony of truth in our ſelves, as well as from the Scriptures of Truth without us, that we may be Inſtruments in the hands of the Lord, to build up one another in the moſt Holy Faith, in Chriſt the Truth, the Power of God: but 'tis neither agreeable to the Teſtimony of Truth in us, nor yet the Scriptures of Truth without us, for any to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves of Ability to <hi>eſtabliſh God's Power:</hi> for its that by which the World was made. Now the <hi>Order of the Goſpel</hi> is the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and nothing elſe (according to the declared ſence of our ancient Friends) can properly be called the <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> but the <hi>Power of God:</hi> for though ſome outward Form or appearance may be according to the <hi>Order of the Goſpel;</hi> yet it can no more properly be called the very <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> than the Fruit of a Tree, can be called the Tree it ſelf; and therefore thoſe who pretend to <hi>eſtabliſh the Order of the Goſpel,</hi> may as well pretend to <hi>eſtabliſh the Power of God it ſelf.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>this Power is of Ability to eſtabliſh Man in the Faith of God's Elect; but Man is not of Ability to eſtabliſh it:</hi> thoſe who underſtand the Nature and Tenours of the two Covenants, may eaſily diſcern the Truth hereof.</p>
                  <p>Under the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> which was outward, the mind of God was manifeſted to the People from the Prieſts Lips, <hi>which were to preſerve Knowledge;</hi> and this Covenant did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in divers Outward Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſtabliſht and impos'd upon the People, until the Time of Reformation. Under the <hi>Second Covenant</hi> (being the New Covenant or Goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation) the Mind and Will of God is manifeſted in his People through the Revelation of his Spirit: according to that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1.19. <hi>That which may be known of God, is manifeſted in them;</hi> Chriſt alſo ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things.</hi> The Law under this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is written in the heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>I will write my Law in their Hearts, &amp; they ſhall not teach every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; for all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57559:153"/>ſhall Know me, &amp;c.</hi> Here's not the leaſt ground of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for any man under the New Covenant (which was not to be like unto the Old) to pretend, that Gods Spirit doth or will lead any, to eſtabliſh <hi>Outward Orders,</hi> relating to <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conſcience,</hi> as the <hi>Order of the Goſpel:</hi> for if that which is to be known of God is manifeſted <hi>in us,</hi> then (though it may be needfull to ſtir up, according as the Lord ſhall move in his ſervants the pure Mind in us, that ſo we may be in the Exerciſe of what God requires (through the maifeſtation of himſelf in us) there is no need to eſtabliſh any thing <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us,</hi> to ſhew it. If the Spirit of Truth is to lead into all truth; thoſe who would be leading us in another way, will prove little better then Thieves and Robbers, which Climb up another way to enter in, than by the door. If the Law be written in the heart, and that <hi>no Obedience finds Acceptance with the Lord, but Obedience to his Law, from an inward Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe and Drawing of his Spirit thereunto</hi> in our ſelves; there's no need of eſtabliſhing Outward Indiſpenſible Rules, which may relate to the Conſcience, to walk by; for were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo to do, and any ſhould yield Obedience on no better ground, then becauſe'tis ſo eſtabliſh't by ſuch a Man, or Aſſembly of Men; this ſort of Obedience would find no more acceptance with the Lord, than the offering of Swines fleſh (or the Halt and Blind for a Sacrifice) under the Firſt Covenant did. For though many may be ſo Weak, as not to know the difference between the two Covenants in ſome reſpects; yet there are Few of the Lord's People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> but have this undoubted Truth ſealed in their hearts, <hi>That none of their Outward Practices, under the Exerciſe of Chriſt's Government, find's acceptance with the Lord, but as they have an Evidence in their Conſciences, that therein they Anſwer the meaſure of Truth in themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> thus ſaith, <hi>As ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him, Rooted and built up in him, ſtabliſhed in the Faith,</hi> Col. 2.6, 7. And then the very next
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57559:153"/>verſe ſaith, <hi>Beware leſt any man ſpoyl you, through the Traditions of men, according to the Rudimnets of the World, and not after Chriſt.</hi> If the following outward Decrees, Precepts Sentences, Deciſive Judgment, or Traditions of any ſort of the Church, had been in <hi>Pauls'</hi> Eye, a real and certain Indication, of being <hi>Eſtabliſh't in the Faith,</hi> or <hi>rooted in Chriſt,</hi> or that 'twas the Practice of the Church to be <hi>Eſtabliſhing Outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible Orders,</hi> relating to the Conſciences of Believers, I leave it to the Judicious Reader to ſavour, whether <hi>Paul,</hi> would have ſo immediately, and as it were in one breath, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd them <hi>to beware, of being ſpoyled through the Traditions of Men,</hi> &amp;c. without a further Caution to take heed, leſt they ſhould account the Commands, Sentences, Decrees, or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Church ſuch. Theſe things conſidered, and compared with the Meaſure of Light in our ſelves, I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed 'tis not agreeable to Truth, for any Man or Aſſembly of Men, to atempt an Outward Indiſpenſible <hi>Eſtabliſhment of Outward Orders, Rules, and Decrees, relating to Matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences under the New Covenant, as the Orders, Rules, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, if Chriſt did ſtand in need of Aſſiſtance to <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abliſh his Government,</hi> how is it poſſible that Man, <hi>whoſe dayes are but as a ſpan long,</hi> ſhould be capable to <hi>Eſtabliſh that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of whoſe increaſe there ſhall be no end; but ſo it is, that he doth not ſtand in need thereof; <hi>For the Son that is given, ſhall Order his Government, and Eſtabliſh it with Judgment and with Juſtice even from henceforth and forever:</hi> read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. Beſides, if we do but conſider, where and after what manner the ſecond appearance of Chriſt hath been, and yet is to be expected and waited for; thoſe who know the Truth as preach't, received, and believed amongſt the People of the Lord called <hi>Quakers</hi> in the Beginning, do know, <hi>That his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Appearance hath been, and yet is to be expected, and waited for in the hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Men,</hi> and the manner of his appearance hath been and is by his Spirit in us,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57559:154"/>this hath often been teſtifyed, and that in oppoſition to thoſe, who have been looking for his Second Coming in ſome Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bodily Appearance, to reign as Lord and King.</p>
                  <p>I now appeal to Gods Witneſs in all Conſciences, Whether the <hi>Outward Eſtabliſhment</hi> of <hi>Outward Government,</hi> under the notion of Chriſt's Government, doth not ſeem to ſquare more with the Principles of ſuch, who look for his Second Coming in ſome Outward Bodily Appearance, than with the Principles of thoſe, who conclude his Second Coming to be by his Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Appearance in the heart? and whether it be not inconſiſtent with Right Reaſon and Truth, to conclude, that Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, will <hi>Eſtabliſh</hi> his <hi>Government</hi> otherwiſe than by his Spirit, and in the heart, where his Appearance hath been, and is to be expected and waited for?</p>
                  <p>And ſince it is undoubtedly ſo, that <hi>of the increaſe of Chriſt's Government there ſhall be no End:</hi> I cannot underſtand to what End any Man ſhould concern himſelf to conſider, <hi>how far it may extend;</hi> yet <hi>R.B.</hi> hath ſo done: Witneſs his 37 Page, where he thus ſaith, <hi>It is next to be conſidered, in what Caſes, and how far it may extend.</hi> To which I cannot but thus reply.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who are not Puft up with Spiritual Pride, or Zeal without Knowledge, may eaſily diſcern from ſuch kind of language, a Spirit that would Limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by putting Bounds unto that Government <hi>of whoſe increaſe there ſhall be no end;</hi> and though I ſpeak of <hi>Man's inability to Eſtabliſh Chriſt's Government;</hi> yet I would not be underſtood, as one accuſing the aforeſaid Author or any elſe, to aſſert Man's Ability ſo to do. For I know not any Men that will pretend themſelves in that Caſe, other than Inſtruments in God's Hands. But yet this is to be Obſerved, that ſince there is no Ground to believe, that God everwill make uſe of Man, under the New Covenant to <hi>Eſtabliſh</hi> outward inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſible Orders, Rules or Decrees, to be as a meaſuring-line, whereby thoſe who are under Chriſt's Government ſhall be known; therefore 'tis reaſonable to conclude, <hi>That the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57559:155"/>Meeting is appointed, are the Perſons by whom ſuch Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (whether given forth by a <hi>Paul</hi> a Father, or a <hi>Timothy</hi> a Son) as are for publick ſervice, are approved, or diſapproved.

                     <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. Treats of the diverſities of Gifts by one and the ſame Spirit, mentioning ſeveral of them, <hi>viz. The Word of Wiſdom, the Word of Knowledge, Faith, Gifts of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Working of Miracles, Propheſy, Diſcerning of Spirits, divers kinds of Tongues, Interpretation of Tongues;</hi> and then at length ſaith, <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church.

He thus ſaith, <hi>having then gifts differing, according to the Grace that's given to us, whether Propheſy, let us Propheſy, according to the Proportion of Faith; or miniſtry, let us wait on our Miniſtry; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all which 'tis evident, that God hath given diverſities of Gifts; and that thoſe Members, who may be <hi>skilful</hi> through the Grace of God to Exerciſe <hi>one Gift,</hi> may be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillfull</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſhould any number of Perſons, amongſt whom there ſhould be only ſuch, whoſe Gifts are either to Propheſy, Teach, or Exhort; but not to diſcern Spirits, ſit together, and take upon them to conſider, <hi>whether that which is given forth for publick Service by any Brother, ſeriouſly declaring that God moved thereunto, ought to come to publick View, and be found hindring the coming forth of the ſame, when nothing unſound ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; they</hi> would therein make a Breach on that Chriſtian-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which ought to be preſerved inviolable in the Church of God: Nay, if peradventure there ſhould be ſome amongſt them, whoſe Gifts are to diſcern Spirits, and ſo accordingly gives their approabation, or diſapprobation; it becomes not others, not gifted therein, to concern themſelves; becauſe their Duty is (if <hi>Paul's</hi> Counſel be good) to wait on their own Gift; and though ſuch may declare, they have Unity therewith in the Life; Yet that may be only the Fruit of their Lips, or of a haſty Spirit, that may have Zeal without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when the Matter wherewith they declare themſelves at Unity, is without the Compaſs of their Gift, Knowledge, or Capacity to Judge of. But yet, I would not be underſtood, that it is unneceſſary for the Members of the Church of Chriſt to take care, that nothing Scandalous to the Truth come forth in Publick, under the name of any who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof: and were it ſo, that I had ought upon me on Truths behalf, to bring to publick View, I ſhould be glad of the Opportunity to lay it before ſuch Brethren, with whom the Word of Wiſdom, Knowledge, and Diſcerning of Spirits dwelt: yet am perſwaded the Lord would preſerve me from ſuffering the Counſel of any to lead me, contrary to what I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57559:156"/>believed the Lord moved; unleſs through the Word of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge they could convince me of Errour, and ſo come to ſee it my place to forbear. And this I account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Truth, which preferrs <hi>Obedience to our own Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Grace, before Obedience to the Meaſures of others;</hi> and to wait on <hi>our own Gifts,</hi> and <hi>not the Gifts of others;</hi> even as I account it contrary to Truth, and as a Branch ſpringing from that Spirit which would limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Approbation of <hi>Coming,</hi> or <hi>not Coming</hi> of all Writings whatſoever given forth on a Religious Account to publick View, unto the Judgment of any, unleſs ſuch as are perfectly skilful in all Spiritual Gifts, Myſteries, and Knowledge, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Matters appertaining to Gods Kingdom, and the Salvation of Mankind. Had this <hi>uncertain unſelected Aſſembly</hi> ſpoken of, been ſuch, at the time when <hi>R. B's</hi> ſmall Treatiſe was approved, doubtleſs it would never have paſt, as that whereby Truth would be promoted, through a Belief of all the Matters which therein he aſſerts for Truth.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when I conſider that all Miſcarriages in Writings approved at that Aſſembly doth not only become the error of a perticular perſon, but of that Aſſembly alſo; &amp; not only ſo, but peradventure may be reflected (though unworthily) on the whole Body of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> on a common Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that having paſt the Teſt of that Meeting, the whole Church approves thereof; I am even ready to query, <hi>Whether it were not better to let every Man ſtand, or fall to his own Maſter in this reſpect, unleſs ſome better Expedient might be found, than ſuch an one, as hath admitted of ſuch Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Aſſertions as (to the diſhonour of Truth) are contained in</hi> R.

                  <p>From all which I do according to Truth thus conclude, <hi>That it is groundleſly aſſerted by</hi> R. B. (in the Senſe I take his Lines to import) <hi>viz.</hi> with reſpect to Outward Orders) <hi>that the ancient Apoſtolick Order of the Church of Chriſt, is Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongſt the People of God called</hi> Quakers: Yet I do teſtify, that the Government of Chriſt ought to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in, and over his Church; and that though the Order of this Government is not ſo deſcribed, as that by any Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rule, or Written Preſcription (as a ſufficient Means) Man may exactly walk therein; Yet I am perſwaded, that there are many of Gods People amongſt thoſe who in Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that have been ſo Obedient unto that Grace, which hath been given them according to the Gift of Chriſt, as that it may be truly ſaid of them, <hi>That they are Eſtabliſhed in the Faith of Gods Elect, and that they are in Subjection, according to their Meaſures, to the Government of Chriſt, which by the Authority of his own Power, and Spirit, he hath Eſtabliſh'd in their Inward Parts; ſo that through that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which is of Faith</hi> (other Obedience availing not) <hi>they are exerciſing themſelves according to the Leadings of Chriſt's Light, and in Subjection unto the Laws appertaining unto his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which are not written in Tables of Stone, but in the Heart, according to the Tenour of the New-Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.9, 10, 11. And that thoſe who are Inveſted with Power from on high, may be Inſtruments in Gods Hand, according to the Diſpenſation thereof given them of God, to ſtir up the Pure Mind in others, ſometimes by way of Admonition, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſound Doctrine, and ſometimes, by Charge or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, according as the Spirit of the Lord moves, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; and yet every one of theſe Operations, according to the Diſpenſation of God, is only to ſtir up the pure Mind, that ſo through a ſenſible Cloſing with the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, ſhining in the Heart, God's Witneſs in the Conſcience may be raiſed in Dominion; for that 'tis according to Truth to affirm, that the Admonition,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57559:157"/>Doctrine, and Exhortation, Charge, or Command of any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, cannot be rightly received, and imbraced, otherwiſe than according to the Leadings of Chriſts Light, that ſo it may appear, <hi>that the Excellency of that Power is of God, and not of Men:</hi> read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>That the Holy Scriptures give not the leaſt Teſtimony, that the Apoſtles, nor any Perſons under the Notion of the Church of Chriſt, endeavoured to <hi>Eſtabliſh</hi> any Outward Orders, and then term them the Order of the Goſpel, the Power of God: much leſs ſo to <hi>Eſtabliſh</hi> any Outward Order, or Form of Diſcipline in the Church, as that not only a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation therefrom,</hi> but a <hi>not Imbracing</hi> thoſe <hi>Outward Forms,</hi> or <hi>Orders,</hi> by ſuch Believers, who were never in the Practice thereof, ſhould be a Token, that they were departed from the Faith: but their Labours were, to Eſtabliſh the Churches in the Faith, and in the Power (rather than to build up Forms, or Orders) having them ſo <hi>Eſtabliſh'd,</hi> to be in the Practice of that Form, which the Power either had, or ſhould lead them into: and therefore the Apoſtle might well ſay, <hi>Be ye not unwiſe, but underſtand what the Will of the Lord is,</hi> (he doth not ſay what the Will of the Church is, but what the Will of the Lord is) <hi>ſubmitting your ſelves one to another in the Fear of God.</hi> According to which Submiſſion, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Gods Witneſs, <hi>Whether it may not become as well the Duty of the Brethren to ſubmit to one or two, as one or two to ſubmit to the Brethren?</hi> and <hi>whether theſe kinds of Submiſſion have not been practiſed amongſt the People of the Lord called</hi> Quakers, <hi>in theſe latter Days?</hi> And though I ſay, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>[not the Church, but what the Will of the Lord is]</hi> yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I would not be underſtood to render Chriſt and his Church divided: but rather to ſhew, that his Will, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Err, is a ſurer Foundation to Build upon, than the Wills of thoſe, who if they depart from Chriſt their Rock, may Err. <hi>R.

                  </p>
                  <p>On which I thus obſerve, If Differences happen between two Brethren, and not through the leaſt intention to wrong each other, then the Power of Truth in themſelves will conſtrain ſuch to chooſe Faithful Brethren, skil'd in the Matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ, to decide the ſame, and accordingly to ſubmit, and all this of a willing and ready Mind, <hi>through the Power of Truth in themſelves,</hi> and <hi>not through conſtraint of others:</hi> and ſo in this caſe, here's no need for any to come to their Brethren, and ſay, <hi>We do Boldly aver, we have Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to decide, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe this enſuing caſe ſhould happen, <hi>viz, That two Brethren are at variance, touching their Properties and Outward Concerns, relating to</hi> Meum <hi>and</hi> Tuum <hi>(as R.B's. terms are) and one of them is ſo departed from Truth in himſelf, as that he will not of a ready Mind ſubmit his Cauſe to the hearing of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be choſen by themſelves indifferently: but being Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, will either go to Law, or elſe ſo abound in his own ſenſe as nothing ſhall ſerve, but to be Judge in his own cauſe.</hi> If we now enquire, what Chriſt the Truth doth in general direct, and wherein this Caſe may be comprehended, which is ſo great an offence to the other Brother (whom Truth conſtrains to ſubmit his Cauſe to the Hearing and Judgment of Perſons indifferently choſen, and that of a willing and ready mind) we ſhall find, he thus ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. <hi>If thy brother ſhall Treſpaſſe againſt thee, go tell him his fault between thee and him alone; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more; if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; if he hear not the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man.</hi> Chriſt's words do not here import, that the Church hath Power over any man's Worldly Property, or Outward Concerns; it only ſaith, <hi>If he neglect to hear the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57559:158"/>Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man.</hi> And when a Brother is, through the declaration of the Church, become ſo to the other Brother, againſt whom he hath treſpaſſed, then the Offended Brother may Juſtly ſeek his Remedy, (if the Offence and Treſpaſs be touching Outward Concerns) according to the Juſt Lawes of men, relating to Property.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps ſome may Object thus. <hi>This relates not to Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affaires, but to Offences that are of a Spiritual Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer it may be ſaid, As to that, the Scripture is wholly ſilent, and therefore every Caſe wherein one Brother may treſpaſs againſt another, may according to Right Reaſon be comprehended in it; and ſince the Caſe is ſtated between two Brethren, and that on an orderly proceeding, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Church, the ſentence for not hearing the Church is, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man;</hi> to me it ſeemes to import, that the Treſpaſs intended, was ſuch an one, as in a particular manner is againſt one Brother more than another: and ſo as probable to be about their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes, as any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if we do but conſider, that if a Brother be ſo much departed from the Truth, as after Admonition by the Church not to Joyn with his Brother, with whom he is at Variance in the choice of one or more to decide the matter, 'tis a certain Token that he is out of that, which was the bond, by which he became center'd into the Heavenly Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Body, the Church; And ſo then, if it really were ſo, that any Aſſembly under the Notion of the Church of Chriſt ſhould aſſume to themſelves Power and Authority to decide, in Caſes relating to Property; yet in this and the like Caſe there can be no tolerable Pretence to exerciſe a Juriſdiction Becauſe 'tis in relation to one that hath cut himſelf off from being a member, by departing from the Bond by which he was center'd into the Heavenly Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Body.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57559:158"/>
                  <p>Theſe two Caſes duely weighed and conſidered, ſeem to me to be comprehenſive of all Caſes of Difference touching Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Concerns, that may happen amongſt the Members of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Firſt</hi> it plainly appears, there is no need for any to ſay, <hi>We boldly aver, we have Power and Authority to decide,</hi> ſince in all ſuch Caſes there is no uſe of any ſuch Authority, when the Power of Truth manifeſted in themſelves, hath been a Bond upon them to ſubmit to the thing that's Juſt.</p>
                  <p>And by the <hi>Second,</hi> it appears, that if any ſhall aſſume ſuch a Juriſdiction, yet all ſuch Caſes are without the Cogniſance thereof; becauſe 'tis in the Caſe of one that hath cut himſelf off from being a Member (of which ſort <hi>R.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57559:159"/>(ſo far as any thing outward can be) Protections to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and their Properties.</p>
                  <p>But neither the Scriptures without us, nor the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, do evidence, that under the Spiritual Government of Chriſt, there is any need to <hi>Eſtabliſh</hi> Orders or Laws touching worldly Property, or for the Members of Chriſt to aſſume Juriſdiction therein, without <hi>aſſent</hi> of the Parties differing. For, <hi>ſince his Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> Is it not againſt the nature of his Government, to exerciſe by Conſtraint, a Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in Matters relating to this World?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, 'tis agreeable to Truth, to affirm, That <hi>nothing outward can Conſtrain the Subjects under Chriſt's Government to obey the Laws thereof, ſince the only proper place, where his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is to be exalted, is in the Heart (the place where his Second Appearance to reign as Lord and King is, and ſhall be) and that the Means whereby, under his Government, Acceptable Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence comes to be yielded, is by his Spirit.</hi> If then nothing <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> can be of force to Conſtrain <hi>Acceptable Obedience,</hi> how can it be agreeable to Truth and Right Reaſon, for the true Church of Chriſt it ſelf (muchleſs any Aſſembly term'd ſo, and that on tolerable Suppoſition only, of which more anon) to aſſume a Juriſdiction in Caſes relating to Property, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the Parties concerned, when they have no ſuitable Power to <hi>Compel Obedience,</hi> nor yet to inflict any <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhment,</hi> or <hi>Reſtraint</hi> for the Non-performance of their Sentences?</p>
                  <p>And though the Prophet ſaid, which <hi>R. B.</hi> quotes; <hi>I will reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, and thy Counſellors as at the beginning;</hi> Yet this is no Proof that the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> ought to aſſume Juriſdiction in Temporal Worldly Matters, without Conſent of the Parties concerned, muchleſs any Aſſemblies ſo termed, and that only on tolerable Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſhould the aforeſaid Author by the words <hi>Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellors as at the beginning,</hi> conclude the Propheſy related to <hi>ſuch Judges, as were choſen Men over certain
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57559:159"/>Numbers of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who Judged the People at all Seaſons, but brought the hard Cauſes to</hi> Moſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.25, 26. Yet this gives not the leaſt Warrant for <hi>uncertain unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Aſſemblies,</hi> to aſſume ſuch a Juriſdiction; but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it wholly: we find Chriſt himſelf gives no Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to ſuch a Senſe, with relation to Outward Matters, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.13, 14. where 'tis thus ſaid. <hi>And one of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſaid, Maſter, bid my Brother divide the Inheritance with me;</hi> and what ſaid Chriſt in this Caſe? He thus ſaid. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14, <hi>Man, who made me a Judge, or Divider over you?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, there is not the leaſt Countenance for any Aſſemblies of Men under the Notion of the Church of Chriſt, to aſſume ſuch an Authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.

                  <p>There is a vaſt difference between an <hi>aſſuming a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction without a Lawful Authority, as to Outward Things relating to</hi> meum <hi>and</hi> tuum, <hi>and a rightful Conſent and Election to Judge.</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57559:160"/>hath opened a wide Gap (ſhould his Judgment take place) for an intolerable In-road to be made on the Properties of People, even as elſewhere in his Treatiſe he hath done upon their Conſciences, as in this enſuing Diſcourſe is plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; for when I ſeriouſly conſider how in his 68. Page he affirms, <q rend="margQuotes">"That there neither can nor will be wanting in Caſe of Controverſy the Spirit of God to give Judgment, through ſome or other in the Church of Chriſt, ſo long as any Aſſembly can properly, or in any tolerable Suppoſition, be ſo termed:</q> and that he would not be contented with theſe words <hi>[properly ſo termed]</hi> but muſt alſo add theſe words <hi>[any tolerable Suppoſition]</hi> and that with disjunctive [or] I cannot but ſuppoſe (ſince I know he well underſtands the <hi>Propriety of Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Signification of words</hi>) that his words do declare the Intent of his Mind, and are not the ſlip of his Tongue or Pen: But how unreaſonable it is that Matters of Worldly Property, and things relating to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhould be decided by ſuch Aſſemblies, without an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for that Service by the Parties differing; I ſhall leave it to the Judicious, Impartial Reader to ſavour; having elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in this following <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> plainly evidenced, that there may be ſuch Aſſemblies, and yet not owned by the Lord for the Church of Chriſt, and ſo may be remote from giving Righteous Judgment; though <hi>R. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gods Spirit will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bewanting in ſuch Aſſemblies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas ſome may be ſo charitable as to conclude, R. B. <hi>intends not by his words, that any ſhould aſſume Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to decide Differences relating to Outward Things, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Parties concerned;</hi> to ſuch I ſay, He hath left no room for a reaſonable Man ſo to think, becauſe he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeveral Pages to prove his Aſſertion, which in that caſe is all unneceſſary; for who can be ſo Ignorant as not to know, that Perſons choſen by the differing Parties, have of Right Power to decide? but if any ſhould, I know that <hi>R. B.</hi> is none of them: my Acquaintance with him tells
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57559:160"/>me not only ſo, but alſo that he is a man of better reaſon than to have written ſo many Lines on this Subject, without tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Reader ſo, if that had been his meaning. Beſides, if the Aſſent of Parties was intended and that the Order of this Government reach'd not to this Caſe without ſuch aſſent, it naturally follows, that the Power and Authority pretended to in this Caſe, is none at all.</p>
                  <p>And now, that the Reader may not have a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of my Senſe in relation to Differences touching Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Things, I have this Teſtimony on the behalf of Truth to give on this Occaſion. <hi>viz.</hi> That as on the one hand I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, 'tis contrary to the Truth for any number of Men, under the Notion of the Church of Chriſt, to aſſume a Juriſdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Brethrens Properties, and Worldly Concerns, when not choſen by conſent of ſuch over whoſe outward Concerns they aſſume Power to Judge; ſo on the other hand, if Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ariſe between Brother and Brother, I do conclude, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law before Unbelievers is an Indication, that one or both are departed from the Truth; and that it is the Duty of Such, who are at Variance, to requeſt ſuch Brethren as are Skil'd in the Matters touching which they differ, to hear and determine the Cauſe, and then of a <hi>willing and ready Mind</hi> (and not as by <hi>Conſtraint</hi>) to ſubmit unto ſuch Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; and that it ought to be as an Incombent Duty on the Members of Chriſts Church to be watching over one another, ſo as that by wholſom Counſel, Admonition, and Sound Doctrine, all Variance, Strife, Emulation, Rents and Diviſions, both in relation to <hi>Temporal,</hi> as well as <hi>Spiritual Matters,</hi> may as much as in them lies be kept out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Members of Chriſts Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R. B.</hi> aſſerts, Page the 11. <q rend="margQuotes">"That the Ground of Schiſmes, Diviſions, or Rents in the Body is, when any Member aſſumes another Places than is allotted it, or being gone from the Life, lets in the Eye that watches for Evil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Poſition is Truth, and rightly Stated; but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57559:161"/>I cannot but Teſtify, that if any Member of Chriſts Body doth recommend that Adminiſtration or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherein by Gods Spirit he is Exerciſed, unto his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſhall Judge all ſuch Dark Spirits, and out of the Unity of the Body, who on ſuch a Recommendation become not Exerciſed as he is, or doth not immediately cloſe with his Experience and Operation, though otherwiſe Faithful to the Meaſure of Grace received, ſuch an one ſo Judging, may juſtly be Judged of the Lord, as a Perſon not only <hi>aſſuming another Place in the Body than is allotted him,</hi> but alſo <hi>as endeavouring to draw others into the like Snare:</hi> for that it is as probable that a true Member of Chriſts Body may be as remote from having Experience of his Brothers Operation, as the Ear of the natural Body may be from diſcerning what the natural Eye doth ſee; and yet the Ear, according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16. may as truly be accounted a Member of the Body as the Eye.</p>
                  <p>'Twas an Exhortation in the Beginning of the Day which in theſe latter Years hath Dawned amongſt us, <hi>Though thou grow but ſlow, yet grow ſure.</hi> This ſure growing was <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience after Convincement,</hi> or <hi>Obedience to the Meaſure of Grace received.</hi> All Performances before, with reſpect to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Services for God, were accounted but Will-worſhips, or Will-ſervices: and therefore many, whoſe Faces were <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>-ward, did rightly teſtify on this wiſe, <hi>I muſt ſtay until I be Convinced;</hi> and ſince, <hi>I ſee not this to be wrong, I dare not be in the Practice of another thing contrary thereto, leſt I become a Will-worſhipper:</hi> And yet this kind of Language is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Underſtanding) too reflectingly ſpoken of by the afore-ſaid Author, witneſs his 13th.

                  <p>This puts me in mind to ſignify what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. <hi>No man can ſay, Jeſus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 'Tis the Fame of Truth that Jeſus (as in himſelf) is Lord; and ſo we know a wicked man (not acted by the Spirit) may ſay theſe words, <hi>Jeſus is the Lord:</hi> Yet none can
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57559:161"/>in Truth ſay, <hi>Jeſus is Lord in them,</hi> but by the Holy Ghoſt: from whence I obſerve, That no Teſtimony, though ever ſo true in it ſelf, can become the Teſtimony of Truth in any, further than through certain Conviction its known to be ſo; even as <hi>Jeſus</hi> cannot in Truth be called <hi>Lord</hi> by us, until by his Spirit we are convinced, and experimentally know that he is <hi>Lord in us.</hi> And therefore I cannot but ſay, <hi>'Tis ſavoury Language to ſay, I M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST STAY <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTIL CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>INCED;</hi> though R. B. (as his lines to me import) accounts ſuch Language to be <hi>a Reaſoning Truth from ones ſelf, through the deceitfulneſs of the Serpent,</hi> querying, <hi>How did they</hi> (meaning the primitive Labourers amongſt the People of the Lord, called <hi>Quakers) knock down this manner of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning?</hi> But doubtleſs herein he hath abuſed both <hi>himſelf</hi> and the Truth; not ſo much for that he knowes no other, than by report, whereof he treats, as to this matter; if his meaning be, <hi>That the primitive Labourers in the Goſpel, at the beginning of that Day</hi> (which in theſe latter Ages hath dawn'd amongſt us) <hi>did condemn ſuch kind of Language;</hi> but for that many of thoſe who yet remain witneſſes of the firſt gathering, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no ſuch thing.

For Chriſt in <hi>this day,</hi> as well as in <hi>that day,</hi> wherein Truth was firſt publiſh't amongſt us, is become our only Teacher and Lawgiver, by the in ſhining of his Light in our conſciences: and therefore his reflection ſeemes unſavoury: But that which to me renders it the more Unſavoury is this, when I conſider the whole ſcope of his <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> 'tis to be doubted, 'tis uſed, ſo far as in him lyes, with reſpect to the Advancement of ſome Outward Government by Man, or Men; elſe what's the Meaning that the aforeſaid Author hath made ſuch a dilligent ſearch amongſt the Apoſtles Writings
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57559:162"/>after the words [<hi>Order, Rule, Command, Govern, Government, Traditions,</hi> and ſuch like] and whether he doth not apply them to the Authority of any aſſembly, which in any tolerable ſupoſition may be term'd the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> let the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader dilligently peruſe his Treatiſe, and then Judge; for ſo its plainly to be diſcovered (as to me appears) by every impartiall Eye, that ſhall ſeriouſly obſerve the ſcope of his <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> and therefore I do conclude, that his Reflection on ſuch ſound and ſavoury Language denotes <hi>a wrong Spirit,</hi> and not the <hi>Spirit</hi> which appear'd amongſt thoſe antient Labourers, who were Inſtruments in Gods Hands to gather many, and who in the Approbation of ſuch Language were accounted Honourable.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in mind to inform the Reader, that R. B. in his third Section quotes divers Teſtimonies in the Scripture where theſe ſentences are, <hi>viz,</hi> 
                     <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>Know them that are over you; hold the Traditions ye have been taught. Though I ſhould boaſt ſomewhat more of our Authority; and we have confidence that ye will do the things which we command: now we command you Brethren,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. (and then the aforeſaid Author comments thereon) <q rend="margQuotes">"what more poſitive then this? And yet the Apoſtle was not here an Impoſer. And further, <hi>If any obey not our word, remember them which have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves.</hi>

                     <hi>Theſe filthy Dreamers deſpiſe Dominion.</hi> And then thus ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">"There can nothing be more plain from theſe Teſtimones, than that ſome did appoint, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain certain things; that there lay an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in point of duty on others to

                           <hi>'Tis to be doubted, his meaning is,</hi> others ought to obey, whether they ſee it their Duty or no; <hi>as his</hi> 68. <hi>Page ſeems to import.</hi>

That this was no Incroachment nor Impoſition on their Chriſtian-Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor any ways Contradictory to their being inwardly led by the Spirit of God in their Hearts: And laſtly, that ſuch as are in the true Feeling and Senſe, will find it their places to Obey, and be one with the Church of Chriſt in ſuch like Caſes; and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57559:162"/>that it's ſuch as have loſt their Senſe, and Feeling of the Life of the Body, that Diſſent and are Diſobedient, under the falſe Pretence of Liberty. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I Judge there will need no great Argument to prove the People of God may, and do well to Exerciſe the like Government upon the very like Occaſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much may be collected out of <hi>R. B</hi>'s 26, 27, and 28. Pages. Moreover in Pages 23. 24. 25. He quotes theſe Scriptures ſayings, viz, <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>In Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you, through the Goſpel; wherefore I beſeech you, be followers of me: As abſent in Body, but preſent in Spirit, have Judged already, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> From all which I ſhall obſerve (ſaith the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid author) <q rend="margQuotes">"that it ſeems it was Judged no Inconſiſtency nor contradiction, to be Followers of the Grace in our ſelves, and alſo to be Followers of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and his waies; becauſe his Waies and Example was no other than the Spirit of God in themſelves would have led them to, if they had been obedient; and therefore he found it needfull to charge them Poſitively, to follow him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding this Reaſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">"Next, the great Argument the Apoſtle uſeth to perſwade them hereunto, upon which he mainly inſiſts, becauſe he had begotten them into the Truth. <hi>Ye have not many Fathers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you, through the Goſpel; wherefore I beſeech you, be ye followers of me.</hi> So he makes that as the cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſee then that the Lord hath, and doth give ſuch, whom he hath ſent forth to gather a People unto himſelf, a certain authority in the Power over them, and to bring them back to their Duty, when they ſtray at any time, and to appoint, yea and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuch things as are needful for Peace, Order, and Unity ſake; and that there lies an Obligation on ſuch as are ſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to Reverence, Honour, yea, and Obey ſuch as are ſet over them in the Lord.</q> Thus far the aforeſaid Author.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That here is nothing ſpoken in theſe Scriptures, <hi>of the Commands of the Church;</hi> and that if God hath at any time moved an Apoſtle on ſome Occaſion to write unto a Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Church (and that perhaps with relation to perticular Members only) by way of Command; yet this, according to right reaſon, is no Ground for any Aſſembly of Perſons, under the Notion of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> to give forth <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commands,</hi> in expectation that all the Members of Chriſts Church muſt obey the ſame, <hi>whether they have a Senſe thereof from the Meaſure of Truth in themſelves or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, R. B.</hi> quoting this Scripture of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> viz. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you, through the Goſpel;</hi> concludes, that <hi>Paul</hi> did mainly inſiſt upon his <hi>begetting them unto the Truth,</hi> as an Argument to perſwade them to obey his poſitive Charge to follow him; by this then, thoſe who have <hi>begotten any to the Truth,</hi> are the fitteſt to rule over ſuch whom they have begotten.</p>
                  <p>If this be worthy Obſervation at this Day, I then may well query, <hi>Whether thoſe who would Rule over ſuch whom they have not gathered, are not Intruders, and Buſy-Bodies, medling with that which concerns others more than themſelves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, I query, <hi>Whether any of theſe fore-going Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give the leaſt Countenance for whole Aſſemblies to Miniſter by their Writings, that which may be Matter of Faith, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Conſcience, and to be a Bond thereon, before their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is illuminated; eſpecially when what they do Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter firſt ſprings from the Gift either but of one, or at moſt but a very few of them?</hi> For ſince every man ought to Miniſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath received the Gift; and that, if any ſpeak, they ought to ſpeak as the Oracles of God; and that if any Miniſter it ought to be done of the ability which God giveth, according to that of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. I cannot but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain query, <hi>Whether the endeavouring to obtain</hi> a Multitude of Hands <hi>to confirm and approve that which is given forth by one, or at leaſt a very few, may not become a Temptation to many to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57559:163"/>run beyond their own Lines; and when they have ſo done, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of waiting on their own Gift, make it their Buſineſs to ſtand by what they have done, though it may prove no better</hi> (in the beſt ſence) <hi>than a ſtanding by the Gifts of others, out of, and in the neglect of their own Gifts?</hi> And ſo ſuch may become but little honour to the Brother, who Miniſtred in his own Gift, as the Oracle of God: and not only ſo, but little credit to the Truth, if ſuch by medling in things without their Line, bring forth Confuſion and Diſorder: For what can be the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of ſuch, who labour and travel in the things they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not, but the Brats of <hi>Babylon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, thoſe who are of ſuch forwardly ſpirits, as to <hi>pin their Faiths on other Mens Sleeves,</hi> and ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men ſay, before they have an Underſtanding opened to ſee the ſame, may oft times approve (notwithſtanding this uſual ſaying, <hi>Can the Brethren Err?</hi>) of ſuch things which are not miniſtred as the Oracles of God, though pretended ſo to be: And if any whoſe Underſtandings God hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcern this kind of weakneſs in ſuch (who (boaſting in other Mens Lines, of things made ready to their Hands) in very deed take too much upon them) do out of true Love endeavour to convince them, that ſo they might wait on their own Gifts. There are ſome ready to bring forth what befel <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> becauſe they ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Ye take too much upon you;</hi> and what befel <hi>Miriam,</hi> becauſe ſhe ſaid, <hi>Hath the Lord indeed ſpoken only by</hi> Moſes? <hi>hath he not ſpoken alſo by us?</hi> and make ſuch a uſe of theſe Scriptures as that they give occaſion of Jealouſy to ſome to conclude, That there are ſome do believe, <hi>that God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up ſome Outward Perſon to be amongst the Children of Light at this Day like unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>and as he was in that Day amongst the Children of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the <hi>Children of Light</hi> in theſe our latter Dayes, I never underſtood of any deſerving an higher Title, than an <hi>Elder,</hi> or <hi>Miniſtring Friend;</hi> But if ſuch mean, <hi>That God hath

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though I pretend not to know the Occaſions whereon the Apoſtles writ, further than the Scripture mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts; yet I do know, how Truth was Preacht in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt thoſe, who (through the Power thereof being gathered) were called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and that many would have undoubtedly fallen, both on the right hand and on the left, ſhould the antient Labourers, after they had been Inſtruments in the Lords hands to gather Thouſands unto the Truth, have thus ſaid:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are your Fathers, who in Chriſt Jeſus have begotten you through the Goſpel; and we have on that foot a certain Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Power over you, and to command ſuch things as are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Order and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nities ſake; and that there lyes an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on you to Reverence, Honour, and Obey us: And though you are our Witneſſes that we have often Declared, that our Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God was, to turn People from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God, that ſo they might all come to be Ordered and Governed by the Appearance of that Power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Yet we did not mean, but that when we had gathered any unto the Truth, we ſhould be thoſe, who ought to have the Rule over
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57559:164"/>them; and that ſuch ſhould obſerve our Traditions, or follow us, without giving them a Reaſon why: And though they might in truth be ſubmitting themſelves one unto another in the Lord, according to the Apoſtles Counſel, yet all of them muſt ſubmit to us, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, Honour and Obey us, and not think it any Contradiction to the being led by the Meaſure of Gods Grace in themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Should our antient Brethren, Labourers in the Goſpel, have thus ſaid, I do not ſee that therein they would render themſelves of another mind, than <hi>R.B.</hi> is of, if his Lines may be lookt upon as the product of his Mind: but ſhould they have ſo done, doubtleſs, as I have ſaid before, many would have fallen, and Jealouſies have enter'd the breaſts of Thouſands, <hi>That though theſe our travelling Brethren, exalted the Spirit of God in man, as the only ſufficient Rule for man;</hi> and declared, <hi>that the Scriptures were not a ſufficient Rule to man; yet in ſtead of leaving us to that Rule, which they have declared to be ſufficient, they ſtrain that which they have declared not ſufficient, to make it as much as in them lyes, a Rule for them to Rule over their Brethren.</hi>

(a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture quoted by <hi>R.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.37. (a Scripture quoted by the aforeſaid Author) thus ſaith, <hi>If any man think himſelf to be a Prophet or Spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandements of the Lord:</hi> and Verſ. 34. of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in the Church, &amp;c.</hi> Here's a poſitive proof that women ought to be ſilent in the Church, and that by the Command of <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore me thinks it ſhould be a ſhame for ſuch who plead for Womens <hi>ſpeaking in the Church,</hi> and not only ſo, but for their Service with reſpect to Exerciſe in Diſcipline, to pin ſo much (as to me appears the aforeſaid Author doth in his Treatiſe) on the word <hi>Command</hi> us'd by <hi>Paul,</hi> when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of Gods Grace, and Truth which the Children of Light have received, they have and do teſtify, and that according to Truth (notwithſtanding what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, and hath Commanded) that
<note n="*" place="margin">Note, <hi>I would not hereby be underſtood to juſtify</hi> All Women <hi>that have ſpoken in our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe many of them have of late been ſo rude in their Oppoſition to</hi> John Story, <hi>as that I take it to be a meer Scandal to Religion; and am perſwaded that by</hi> Pauls Command, <hi>the meaning of the Spirit was not poſitively according as his own words ſeem to intiate, not only becauſe the Prophet</hi> (Joel 2.28.) <hi>propheſied</hi> that the Lord would pour out of his Spirit upon Sons and Daughters, and that they ſhould Propheſy; <hi>but alſo for that in the ſame Chapter</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) <hi>he exhorts the Church (who doubleſs conſiſted of</hi> Women <hi>as well as</hi> Men) <hi>to</hi> Covet Spiritual Gifts, but rather that they might Propheſy, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Ye may all Propheſy one by one: <hi>all which conſidered; tis rational to take the Mind of the Spirit to he, that there were ſome</hi> unruly, diſorderly Women <hi>then in the Church (as in theſe our Days are) who then had need (as ſome now have) to be warned to keep ſilence, though others, that had received a Revelation from God, might declare the ſame in the Church when met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>

                  <p>And ſince as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57559:166"/>teſtifies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. <hi>That his Authority was given him for Edification, and not for Deſtruction;</hi> I cannot but be more Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable than to think, <hi>Paul</hi> ever uſed the Words <hi>Command, Ordain, Traditions, and ſuch like,</hi> on any other account, but that <hi>the Churches ſhould be followers of him, according as in their own Meaſures they had a Senſe, or Savour, that he was a Follower of Chriſt, and not otherwiſe:</hi> which comparing <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13, 14, 15, 16. doth evidently appear. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Scripture to the <hi>Philipians</hi> thus ſaith, <hi>Brethren, be Followers together of me; and mark them that walk ſo, as you have us for an Enſample:</hi> that to the <hi>Corinths</hi> ſaith, <hi>But we will not boaſt of Things without our Meaſures, but according to the Meaſures of the Rule which God hath diſtributed to us, a Meaſure to reach even unto you; for we ſtretch not our ſelves beyond our Meaſure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not boaſting of things without our Meaſures, that is, other mens Labours; but having hope, when your Faith is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that we ſhall be enlarged by you, according to our Rule, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, not to boaſt in another mans Lines, of things made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to our Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence tis evident, thoſe who keep to their own Meaſures, follow <hi>Paul</hi> as they have him for an enſample; and that thoſe who hope and deſire their Brethrens Conformity to their Lines, before they have faith therein, are of another Hope than <hi>Paul</hi> was, who (as is above recited) thus ſaid, <hi>Having Hope when your faith is encreaſed; that we ſhall be enlarg'd by your, according to our Rule abundantly.</hi> And ſo it plainly appears, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not deſire the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to walk by his Line, until their faith was encreaſed, otherwiſe they might become Proud Boaſters of other mens Lines, made ready to their Hands, as many, yea, too to many, at this day are.</p>

                  <p>The force of <hi>R B</hi>'s Reaſon I apprehend to be chiefly comprehended in, or drawn from theſe his following words, as by his writing Page 48, 49. more at Large, appears. <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q rend="margQuotes">"That we being gathered together into the Belief of certain Principles and Doctrines (through the force of Truth on our Underſtandings) and Practices neceſſarily depending upon them, theſe are as it were the Terms, that have drawn us together, and Bond by which we become cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into one Body, and Fellowſhip.</q> Yet ſaith he by a Marginal Note, <q rend="margQuotes">"Not ſo the Bond but that we have alſo a more inward, viz. <hi>the Life of Righteouſneſs.</hi>

                  <p>My place now is, to detect the impertinency of <hi>R.</hi> B's reaſon, and to ſhew, that he hath quoted Scriptures, which are not to the purpoſe, yet I cannot but firſt obſerve, that ſince the main ſcop of his Treatiſe, relating to this Matter, both from Scripture and Reaſon; tends (as it were) cheifly, if not wholly, to evidence, that ſuch Principles, Doctrines, and Practices neceſſarily depending thereon, are the Bond by which we became centered into one Body, and Fellowſhip; is it not to be doubted that theſe kind of Termes have the greateſt room on his Heart, and the Marginal Deſcription of a more <hi>inward Bond,</hi> viz, <hi>the life of Righteouſneſs,</hi> is but like the entertainment of Chriſt in the Manger? But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>I do affirm, the Belief of certain Principles, and Doctrines (though believed thorough the force of Truth on the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) and Practices neceſſarily depending upon them, are not the very terms and Bond, by which the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> at this day, is become center'd into one Body; though I do confeſs <hi>that Certain Principles, Doctrines, and Practices, held and Practiſed in a pure Mind, are the Fruit and Off-ſpring of that which is the Bond; but the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ery Bond they are not:</hi> If they were, how comes it to paſſe, that to this day, the Members of Chriſts Body (which is his Church) have not declared and agreed, what and how many are thoſe Principles, and Doctrines, and what are thoſe Practices neceſſarily depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon, that ought to be believed, received, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by every member of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> as that by which they are center'd into the Heavenly Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Body?</p>
                  <p>With confidence I may ſay, that I never heard or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of any ſuch thing yet extant amongſt the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> neither do I believe there is; and doubtleſs if there was, the aforeſaid Author being a man (to ſpeak after the manner of men) that is well read, and not of a Mean capacity, would have quoted it, to free himſelf from the cenſure of ſuch, who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57559:168"/>may Juſtly ſay, <hi>He hath left us in the dark, how to know theſe Members, who</hi> (to uſe his own Language, Page 49.) <hi>cut themſelves off from being Members, by diſſolving the very Bond, by which they were linked to the Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, I may truly ſay, <hi>That in the primitive dayes, there were many believers; who were found in Oppoſite Faiths and Practices;</hi> witneſs thoſe who <hi>Circumciſed, kept a Day, abſtain'd from fleſh;</hi> and others there were, who believed and practiſed quite otherwiſe; and yet we do not find, that the Bond which Center'd them into the heavenly Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Body was broken: for doubtleſs many of them under thoſe Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faiths and Practices, were of the number of ſuch, who were ſanctifyed in Chriſt Jeſus, or at leaſt in ſome meaſure ſanctifying, which is the deſcription of a Member of Chriſt's Body (according as the aforeſaid Author himſelf doth in his Treatiſe ſignify) and this is anſwerable to the Truth it ſelf; Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>For further Diſcovery of the Truth of what I have aſſerted 'tis neceſſary to query.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What are the very Terms and Bond, by which the Church of Chriſt is become centered into one Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is plain, <hi>'Tis the Spirit,</hi> according to <hi>Pauls</hi> Teſtimony, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>For by one Spirit are we all Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into one Body:</hi> Now the Baptiſm of the Spirit may be witneſſed by ſuch, whoſe Integrity might lead them to Die for Truth; but ſhould they be Queſtioned by any one, <hi>What are thoſe Principles, Doctrines and Practices you hold, which were the very Terms by which you came to be Centered into Chriſts Body, and which were the Cauſe that gathered you?</hi> (for ſo are his words, Page 47. relating to Principles and Doctrines) they would be ready thus to ſay, <hi>What blind Queſtions doſt thou bring forth in thy Carnal Senſual reaſoning? 'Twas Gods Power and Spirit gathered us from amongſt ſuch, as being out of the Life, gloried in their owtward Fellowſhips, Principles, and Doctrines; and by his Power Circumciſed our Hearts, and by his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57559:168"/>Spirit we came to be baptized into one Body, and ſo are center'd into the heavenly Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Body:</hi> And as for thy ſaying, <hi>A Belief in Certain Principles, Doctrines, and Practices neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily depending thereon, are the Termes and very Bond by which we became center'd into one Body, and the Cauſe that gathered us;</hi> this is not only wrong in it ſelf (though as is ſaid before, they may be the Fruit of the Bond) but exactly like the Falſe Churches in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of all ſorts in the Apoſtacy, have Outward Marks and Tokens (as being either of <hi>ſuch an Order,</hi> or having <hi>ſuch a Commiſſion,</hi> or as <hi>believing in ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and <hi>ſubmitting to ſuch Practices,</hi> and the like) by which the Members of their Churches are deſcribed; and therefore is it that amongſt thoſe, there are outward Societies of Men, certainly known, as aforeſaid, according to the various Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Wayes which their Principles admit and allow of, which are termed the <hi>Church of Chriſt:</hi> and theſe have many Outward Orders, Rules, Preſcriptions, Ordinances, Decrees, or Laws for the Eſtabliſhment and Preſervation of their outward Society, which being agreeable to the nature of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, may become fit means for the Conſervation thereof: but inaſmuch as the Belief of certain Principles, Doctrines, and Practices neceſſarily depending thereon, are not the <hi>very Terms</hi> or <hi>Bond</hi> to unite any in outward Aſſemblies, whereby to aſſume unto themſelves the Title of the Church of Chriſt (for that if held in a pure Mind (which is in the beſt Senſe) they are but the Fruit of that Bond, and when held in an Impure Mind are no Indication that ſuch are Members of <hi>Chriſts Church</hi>) I cannot but ſay, it is againſt right Reaſon for any to <hi>Preſcribe,</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſh Outward Indiſpenſable Rules,</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> relating to the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and in order to be a Bond thereon, for the Conſervation of Chriſts Body, ſince 'tis evident, that the moſt certain and infallible Marks of Memberſhip in the ſaid Body, are Inviſible to the Outward Man, though felt and known to the Inward Man of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57559:169"/>Heart: for though Actions outwardly juſt, are many times the Fruit of the Spirit; yet are not always certain Tokens, that thoſe through whom they appear, are Members of Chriſts Body: but thoſe who are Circumciſed in Heart, and have the Anſwer of a Good Conſcience towards God, are the very Members of <hi>Chriſts Church;</hi> and therefore, the moſt proper Means for the preſervation of ſuch Members in the Unity of the Spirit, and as Members of one Body, is that whereby they came to be Circumciſed in Heart, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered unto the Truth, which is no other but the Spirit, and Arm of Gods Power, which ſurrounds all thoſe that wait upon him, and have a daily Dependence upon the Lord, with the Mind inwardly ſtaid in the Meaſure of that Grace, which the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>is ſufficient for them:</hi> and thus the <hi>Baptiſm of the Spirit</hi> will be witneſſed continually, in which every Member of Chriſts Body comes to be centered into an Heavenly Fellowſhip and Communion each with other in the Life of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I ſhall examine, is, whether <hi>R. B's</hi> Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>viz. Whether the Church of Chriſt hath Power in any Caſes that are Matters of Conſcience, to give poſtive Sentence and Deciſion, which may be Obligatory upon Believers, be agreeable to Truth and Sound Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Obſervation hereon is this, That he hath not here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Inward <hi>Conviction,</hi> whereby they might find <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in themſelves,</hi> to the Sentence of the Church, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Obligation he Intends; and inaſmuch as nothing without an Inward Clearneſs and Conviction, can become a real, and acceptable Bond upon a Believer to be at Unity with his Brethren, in the Belief and Practice of Things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Conſcience, and that thoſe who are found in the Practice of other Mens Lines, before they have Faith therein, may oft times run into the Sin of Hypocriſy, even as others may into the <hi>Sin of Negligence,</hi> who through Unwatchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their own Meaſures, want Clearneſs of Sight, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57559:169"/>Underſtanding to practiſe and joyn with thoſe things, which others (waiting in their <hi>Own Meaſures</hi>) may by the Spirit be led into: Therefore I cannot but ſay, that the Scope and Bent of his Spirit, ſo far as from his words I can Savour, in relation to this Matter, are not agreeable to the Truth and Sound Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And ſince it is ſo, as <hi>R. B.</hi> obſerves, Page 35. <q rend="margQuotes">"That God hath not given us our Reaſons to no purpoſe;</q> I ſhall according to the Line of right Reaſon, a little further Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I find <hi>R.

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That though he affirms, that the Church of Chriſt hath Power in Caſes that are Matters of Conſcience, to give poſitive Sentences and Deciſion, which may be Obligatory upon Believers, yet through his whole Treatiſe I find not that he hath deſcribed, <hi>who are the Perſons that are the Church,</hi> and <hi>where thoſe Perſons do uſually Aſſemble, as the Church of Chriſt;</hi> and therefore though my very ſoul abhors lightly to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57559:170"/>eſteem of the Elect of God, or to undervalue the Power the Church of God either ſtands in, or are indued with; yet ſince I do know, how dangerous a thing it is, for any to burthen the Conſciences of Gods People, though under ever ſo ſpecious Pretences; and that when we ſpeak of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> we mean <hi>Viſible Perſons,</hi> diſtinguiſht as outward Perſons, by Names, that may be known to the Outward Man (though as Members of Chriſt's Body diſtinguiſht not by ſuch Names, but by that Name which is written in Heaven, and known to the Inward Man). I cannot but query, To what end doth the aforeſaid Author aſſign the Deciſion of Caſes of Conſcience (which are Matters certainly to be known) ſo as to be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Believers, to Judges ſo deſcrib'd, as that a greater Controverſy may immediately ariſe, upon the asking of this queſtion, <hi>Who or where thoſe men are?</hi> This, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving <hi>one Difference,</hi> or clearing <hi>one Doubt,</hi> may beget <hi>more.</hi> And whereas it may be ſaid, <hi>We aſſign not to men, as Judges; but to the Spirit of God in Men;</hi> yet this doth not wholly mend the Matter, whileſt the Queſtion remains unanſwered <hi>Who, or where are the Men, thorough whom the Spirit appears to Judge;</hi> or at leaſt ſo unanſwered, as not to remove the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Objections of ſuch as may gainſay: and ſo through theſe things the mind of the Weak may come to be entertain'd with doubtful Diſputations, rather then thoſe things which tend to Edification, contrary to the drift and bent of the Apoſtle's Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I cannot yet ceaſe from a further Obſervation on the aforeſaid Poſition, <hi>viz. [Which poſitive ſentence and deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may become Obligatory on Believers.]</hi> 'Tis true, the aforeſaid Author doth not here ſay, <hi>it ought to become Obligatory upon Believers:</hi> yet to me 'tis evident, that he intends, <hi>that ſuch a Sentence ought to become Obligatory on Believers,</hi> ſeeing on one Inſtance, as Proof to his Affirmation, he thus ſaith, <hi>And is not this Obligatory on all the Members,</hi> &amp;c? Further ſaying,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57559:170"/>with relation thereto, <hi>I cannot tell that any Man of Reaſon can well deny this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which <hi>R. B.</hi> in theſe things ſeemes to drive at, hath (as to me appears) a plain tendency to draw from the Meaſure of Truth in our ſelves (though I dare not be ſo uncharitable as to conclude he ſo intends; and if any Line hath dropt from my Pen which may ſeem to import ſo much, I declare that not to be my Meaning) or at leaſt, to encourage the lending an Ear to the Senſe and Judgment of others, more than to that Senſe and Savour, which we have within our ſelves; For <hi>firſt,</hi> by <hi>Believers,</hi> I take the aforeſaid Author plainly to intend, as well ſuch Believers as are no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in giving forth ſuch Poſitive Sentence, or Deciſion, as thoſe that are: elſe what's the meaning of theſe his words, <hi>And is not this Obligatory on all the Members?</hi> And ſo ſuch unconcerned may have no better Ground to be at Unity therewith, than the ſaying of others. Now I cannot tell how any man of reaſon can make out, that this ſeems any better than this ſort of Language. <hi>[Ye muſt believe as the Church believes]</hi> of which more anon, that I may not be underſtood to reflect on any thing that may in any meaſure ſavour of Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It doth ſeem plainly to contradict this wholeſome Teſtimony of and for the Truth, <hi>viz. That the Sentence and Judgement of any Man or Men whatſoever, relating to Matters of Conſcience, ought not at this day to be given forth, but by way of Recommendation to the Conſcience;</hi> (which to my knowledge hath been the Practice of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) <hi>and when the Conſcience is ſenſible that Gods Witneſs therein anſwers, then the Conſcience is or ought to be bound;</hi> other Bonds may make Hypocrites, and Buſi-bodies, but not good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> tells them, <hi>We recommend our ſelves to every Mans Conſcience in the Sight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2. Here <hi>Paul</hi> became not a Bond upon them, further than
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57559:171"/>they had a Senſe that Gods Witneſs in the Conſcience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as before is quoted, thus: <hi>Having hope, that when your Faith is increaſed, we ſhall be enlarged by you, according to our Rule, abundantly.</hi> This doth not manifeſt <hi>Pauls</hi> Deſire was, that they ſhould walk according to his Rule, until their Faith was increaſed.</p>
                  <p>Let us now examine how <hi>R. B.</hi> by Scripture proves, <hi>that the Poſitive Sentence and Deciſion of the Church in Matters of Conſcience, may be Obligatory upon Believers:</hi> for that he ſaith <hi>I ſhall prove it from Divers Inſtances from Scripture;</hi> and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto I find him to quote only three Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt,</hi> is <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>But though We, or an Angel from Heaven, Preach any other Doctrine unto you, than that which we have Preached unto you, let him be Accurſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this Scripture be a proper Proof of the Matter, then by the Word <hi>[we] Paul</hi> muſt be underſtood to mean the <hi>Church,</hi> and that in the aforeſaid Authors Senſe; Now the aforeſaid Authors Senſe, as appears, Page 68. is, <hi>That ſuch Aſſemblies are the Church, which in any tolerable Suppoſition may be ſo termed;</hi> but doubtleſs <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo exact, as not to deliver any thing, as Doctrine, but what he had ſeen, and handled, according to this Teſtimony recorded in the Scriptures, <hi>What we have ſeen and handled of the Word of Life, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we unto you:</hi> Which being <hi>certain,</hi> and <hi>infallible Tokens,</hi> are more than tolerable Suppoſitions; and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude, <hi>Paul</hi> never intended, that ſuch, who refuſed to be bound in Matters of Conſcience, by the Sentences of every ſuch Aſſembly, which in any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Suppoſition</hi> might be termed the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> ſhould be pronounced Accurſt; much leſs if they ſhall pretend <hi>they ſee it not;</hi> and yet the aforeſaid Author ſaith (as hereafter is manifeſt) to this purpoſe, <hi>That that ſhall not excuſe ſuch from
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57559:171"/>Diſobedience to God, who ſubmit not to the Sentences given forth by ſuch Aſſemblies, or ſome or other of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And likewiſe it ought to appear that a part of that Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which the Church, and not only <hi>Paul</hi> (who as he was moved of the Lord, writ to the Churches by way of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Doctrine) Preached to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> was, <hi>That the poſitive Sentence or Deciſion of the Church, either ought to be Obligatory on all the Members, or at leſt Obligatory on Believers;</hi> or elſe that which by a natural Conſequence might import the ſame: but no ſuch Doctrine, nor the import thereof by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſonable Conſequence appears from the Church, nor yet from <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> or any elſe.</p>
                  <p>And ſince <hi>Paul</hi> is thus quoted, let us enquire how <hi>Paul</hi> did after it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in him; for there were Apoſtles and Elders before him; and yet he ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>I conſulted not with Fleſh and Blood, neither came I again to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to the Apoſtles and Elders before me;</hi> and though 'twas not in a Caſe of controverſy touching Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet 'twas in a Caſe that to him was Matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And when he perceived that <hi>Peter</hi> and other of the <hi>Jews</hi> would have conſtrain'd the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to do like the <hi>Jews, he withſtood</hi> Peter <hi>to the face,</hi> Gal. 2.11, 13. Now <hi>Peter</hi> and thoſe other <hi>Jewes</hi> might have reaſon'd with <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>we are the Brethren, and the Church, and our Practice ought to be a Bond on thee; and thou oughteſt rather to ſubmit to us, than we to thee:</hi> but had they ſo done, doubtleſs <hi>Paul,</hi> would ſtill have withſtood them, and have been Juſtified therein.</p>
                  <p>The Second Scripture <hi>R. B.</hi> quotes is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. which thus ſaith. <hi>Holding Faith and a Good Conſcience which ſome having put away, concerning Faith have made Shipwrack, of whom is</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Allexander, <hi>whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to Blaſpheme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What's this to the purpoſe, to prove, <hi>that the Poſitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and diciſion of the Church in Matters of Conſcience, may bind
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57559:172"/>Believers?</hi> 'Tis ſo remote from it, that it needs no explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſhew it ſo. Nay I may reaſonably query, Whether this Scripture be (to ordinary capacities) plain to the purpoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf intends? For if we conſult the Light, it doth not tell us, that a <hi>Delivery to Satan,</hi> may be an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent whereby to learn not to Blaſpheme; if by the word <hi>Satan</hi> is meant the <hi>Devil,</hi> as is uſually underſtood.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Scripture he quotes for proof is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.10. <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him rejoyce,</hi> for ſo ſaith the aforeſaid Author the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo no mention is made of any <hi>poſitive Sentence,</hi> or <hi>deciſion</hi> of <hi>the Church,</hi> nor yet the import thereof by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſequence; and therefore we will conſider, what the word <hi>Doctrine</hi> is relative to. The foregoing verſe tells us thus, <hi>whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God:</hi> Its now neceſſary to conſider what was <hi>Chriſt's Doctrine;</hi> 'tis well deſcribed by his Sermon in the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. Chapters, wherein there is not the leaſt title to countenance this Sentence, <hi>That the poſitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or deciſion of the Church, in Matters of Conſcience, may be Obligatory on Believers:</hi> Nay in that very caſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16. Where 'tis ſaid, <hi>If thy Brother Treſpaſs againſt thee, go tell him his faults; if he hear thee not, take with thee one or two; if he hear not them, tell it to the Church; if he refuſe to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man.</hi> The Scripture doth not ſay, that Sentence ought to be Obligatory on <hi>all other Members</hi> of the Church of Chriſt, who might be no way concern'd either in the Admonition or Sentence, to look upon him as an Heathen Man; but it ſaith, <hi>Let him be unto [thee] as an Heathen Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt's Doctrine alſo was, that when he ſhould depart hence <hi>the Father would ſend the Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt, which (ſaith he) ſhall teach you all things:</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57559:172"/>Judgment of the Church muſt be Obligatory on all believers,</hi> nor yet <hi>that the Church ſhall teach them all things;</hi> for 'tis evident by the Apoſtles writings, <hi>that they themſelves had need of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Theſe things duely weighed, I do according to Truth conclude, that the three foregoing Scriptures, which he hath quoted, do no way import to prove the Matter he intends.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I remember only one Example of Deciſive Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Sentence given in the Scriptures by the Apoſtles, and Elders (who did it not as aſſuming Authority ſo to do, ſaying, <hi>We are the Church of Chriſt, and we have Power to Decide without your Aſſent:</hi> but what they did was by <hi>aſſent</hi> of the Differing Parties (which <hi>aſſent</hi> is worthy to be noted by ſuch who ſay (as <hi>R. B.</hi> hath) <hi>we boldly aver, we have Power to decide</hi>) and that ſpeaks nothing in favour of what the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Author ſeemed to drive at, when he ſaid, <hi>And is not this Obligatory on all the Members?</hi> but rather the Contrary; and that is in the 15th. of the <hi>Acts, where a Diſſention is Signified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>on the one hand, and certain of the Sect of the</hi> Phariſees (<hi>who Believed and Taught,</hi> Unleſs ye be Circumciſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ye cannot be ſaved) <hi>on the other hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this Queſtion the Apoſtles and Elders agree, that Circumciſion was not fit to be laid on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which were Believers (who never were in the Practice, nor yet had any Faith touching the ſame) yet do not ſay, that their <hi>Sentence</hi> ſhall or ought to be <hi>Obligatory on all the Members of the Church of Chriſt;</hi> nor yet that thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> who practized Circumciſion after they believed, ſhould deſiſt the ſame: for then it might have been lookt upon as <hi>Obligatory</hi> on ſuch <hi>Believing Jews;</hi> and the reaſon of that Sentence doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree with the Teſtimony of Truth received amongſt the People of the Lord called <hi>Quakers</hi> in the Beginning, <hi>viz. To walk according to the Meaſure received:</hi> For the Apoſtles and Elders well knew, that (according as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> Chap. 14.5, 23.) <hi>It was neceſſary for every one to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57559:173"/>perſwaded in their own Minds;</hi> and that, <hi>whatſoever was not of Faith, was Sin:</hi> and ſo could not ſuffer their Sentence (had they had Power ſo to do) to be a Bond on thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who made Conſcience of practiſing Circumciſion, after they had believed, to forbear the ſame: and as to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it doth plainly appear, that the Deciſive Judgment of the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with reſpect to that Controverſy, touching Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was not a Bond upon them, contrary, but according to their Faith; and therefore this Example can be no Preſident, or Warrant for any to ſubmit to the Sentence, or Deciſive Judgment of any whatſoever, wherein there is no Faith, much leſs to conclude, that the Conſcience ought to be bound. For it is no more in the Powers of Believers, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny elſe, to force an aſſent of their own Conſciences, to the Sentences and Deciſive Judgments of others, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themſelves the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> without an Inviſible Operation, and Conviction thereon (through which alone it's capable to be bound) than it is in our Powers ſo to alter the outward Shapes of our Faces, as to make them like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Mens, from whoſe they vary.</p>
                  <p>Moreover when I conſider, how Innumerable Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies have a riſen touching the Authority of the Church, and the Decrees that have been brought forth touching Matters of Conſcience, under the Notion of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> in Ages paſt; and that the like Controverſies in probability may ariſe at this Day, ſhould any number of Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Aſſemble, and not only ſay, we are the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> but alſo thus, <hi>we have power to bind and loſe;</hi> and upon that foot give forth <hi>Poſitive Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Deceſive Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in Caſes that are Matters of Conſcience, in order to be <hi>Obligatory upon Believers;</hi> I cannot but query (eſpecially ſince the People of the Lord called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have not Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up this Doctrine, <hi>(ye muſt Believe as the Church Believes)</hi> but have commended their Teſtimonies on the behalf of Truth to every Mans Conſcience in the Sight of God, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57559:173"/>therein they might be manifeſted) I ſay, I cannot but query, <hi>Where lies the Service to God, and his Truth, for any to concern themſelves to treat on ſuch Subjects, as may give Occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the weak to Doutbfnl Diſputations?</hi> For though Chriſt ſaid <hi>What you bind in</hi> Earth, <hi>ſhall be bound in</hi> Heaven, Yet we do not find in the Scriptures of Truth, that the Apoſtles, or any Aſſembly under the Notion of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> ever made uſe of that <hi>Expreſſion</hi> to ſhew their Authority as <hi>Chriſts Church;</hi> but rather laboured to beget People unto God, that ſo they might become Members of Chriſts Body which is the Church, and be in Subjection to Chriſt the Head, to whom all Power is given in and over his Church, who are Fellow-Members and Fellow-Servants of and in his Body; whoſe Power and Prevalency with the Lord is better demonſtrated by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Waſh each others Feet,</hi> according to the Example of Chriſt their Lord and Maſter, than to be in the Exerciſe of Outward Juriſdiction, <hi>as Lords and Maſters over each other:</hi> For that agrees not with the Teſtimony of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14.10. who thus ſaid, <hi>Why doſt thou Judge thy Brother? why doſt thou deſpiſe thy Brother? for we ſhall all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt; for it is written, ſaith the Lord, every Knee ſhall bow to me, and all Tongues ſhall Confeſs unto God;</hi> ſo <hi>then every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf to God; let us not therefore Judge one another any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſideration of theſe things puts me in mind, that there are ſome, who in their buiſy minds are apt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, <hi>What ſort of Joyes Heaven, Yields to the Faithful after this life;</hi> whenas their time would undoubtedly be much better ſpent, in contemplating how to come thither: or if they have aſſurance thereof, to be demonſtrating the Way to others, if call'd thereto. To this ſort may ſuch be likened, who will needs give themſelves the trouble to treat how far <hi>Chriſt's Government extends,</hi> though <hi>[of its encreaſe there is no end</hi> and <hi>in what Caſes, that are matters of Conſcience, the Church hath Power to give forth Poſitive Sentences, that may
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57559:174"/>obliege Believers;</hi> though nothing can be <hi>an acceptable Bond</hi> upon the Conſcience, until by the Light convinc'd; and that in ſuch Caſes, greater Controverſies may ariſe, <hi>whether ſuch as give forth ſuch Sentences, are the Church or no,</hi> than were before concerning the Matters whereof they aſſume Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: and therefore of ſuch it may be truly ſaid, That their Time might be much better ſpent in the <hi>Exerciſe of their Minds unto God,</hi> that if they are not Subjects of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and under his Government, they may attain thereto, and be ſubject to his Power, to whom all Power both in Heaven and Earth is given, and that being thereunto at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, may be preſerved therein unto the End, and be demonſtrating unto others, how to attain the ſame, if call'd thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Power of deciſion, <hi>R. B.</hi> Page 66. ſaith, as on another occaſion is already quoted; <q rend="margQuotes">"The only proper Judge of Controverſy in the Church, is the Spirit of God, and is not neceſſarily annexed to any Perſons, or Perſon, or Place whatſoever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay, that any have ground to reaſon thus, <hi>Becauſe I am or have been ſuch on emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Member, therefore my Judgment is infallible;</hi> or <hi>becauſe we are the Greateſt Number, or that we live in ſuch a noted or famous Place;</hi> though ſome of theſe reaſons may and ought to have their true weight, in Caſe of Contradictory Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</q>

                  <p>Here I cannot but query, That if the Spirit of God be the only proper Judge of Controverſy in the Church (as the aforeſaid Author ſaith it is) how then can there be any weight in any other thing elſe beſide the Spirit?

And if this be not an apparent mark of an <hi>Impoſing Uſurping Spirit,</hi> and an evident Abuſe to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Truth, and the antient Labourers therein, whoſe Teſtimonies were <hi>[We preach not our ſelves; nor yet that you ſhould be Followers of us; otherwiſe than as you have an Inward Senſe in your ſelves, that we are Followers of Chriſt]</hi> let God's Witneſs in all Judge. To the ſame witneſs I cannot but yet appeal, whether the ſubmiſſion, that ſeems to be aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, is not one of the greateſt ſteps to an Apoſtacy, that hath appeared in our Age, or ſince the Truth hath in theſe latter years been publiſh't amongſt us? for I do know, having been a witneſs of the primitive gathering, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies amongſt us in theſe latter ages, that one part of the Glory of that Adminiſtration, under which Thouſands in theſe Nations were gathered unto God, did conſiſt in this, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had been wandering from Mountain to Hill, from under one form and outward Church-fellowſhip into another, they came to be turned to the ſure guide in themſelves, Chriſt's Light, and warned not to look out, neither to be in the <hi>Lo here's</hi> and the <hi>Lo there's,</hi> but to be faithful to their Own Meaſures; for that according to <hi>Pauls</hi> Teſtimony, God's
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57559:175"/>Grace was given to every one, according to the Meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt. But to return.</p>
                  <p>Let us examine how he proves his firſt Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That there never will nor can be wanting in Caſe of Controverſie, the Spirit of God to give Judgment, through ſome or other in the Church of God, ſo long as any Aſſembly can properly, or in any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Suppoſition be ſo termed.</hi> His Proof is on this wiſe.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <q rend="margQuotes">"To thoſe who believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there will need no other Probation, than that of the 28th. of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the 20th. <hi>And lo I am with you alway, unto the End of the World.</hi> And Verſ. 18. <hi>And the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How this proves the Matter to me, appears not; for theſe Scriptures do neither expreſly, nor by any natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſay, That any Aſſembly is the Church of Chriſt, which may in <hi>any tolerable ſuppoſition</hi> be ſo termed; nor yet ſpeak any thing of Controverſies ariſing amongſt the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Chriſt. Had he brought the firſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove, that Chriſt would be with ſuch whom he at this day makes uſe of to Teach all Nations (as he did his Diſciples at that day) whilſt they ſhould teach to Obſerve the things that Chriſt (to whom all Power is given) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands (not the Commands of Aſſemblies, which may in any tolerable Suppoſition be termed the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> but the things that Chriſt Commands) he had exactly hit the Mark: But as to the Matter, the aforeſaid Author ſeems by his Words to drive at, 'tis far from being to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>And as to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Scripture, had he brought it to prove, <hi>That the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt that Church, which is built on the Rock Chriſt,</hi> 'twould have anſwered the End; But alas! 'tis far remote from proving, that God's Spirit will appear to decide Controverſies in every Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that in <hi>any tolerable ſuppoſition</hi> can be termed <hi>Chriſts Church.</hi> And ſo I cannot but conclude, that theſe and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57559:176"/>other Scriptures, which he hath quoted as Proof of his Aſſertions, <hi>ſeem rather ſtrain'd to Vindicate what he aſſerts, than that his Aſſertions are according to it;</hi> on which hand he ſaith in his Epiſtle to the Reader, <hi>That both</hi> Papiſts <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>have greatly gone aſide;</hi> which might have been a Caution to him, not to have Erred in the ſame Path, as now he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Let us a little further examine his Words, <hi>[Tolerable Suppoſition.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we are not certain of the Truth of any thing, and yet are apt to think it is or may be ſo, we commonly ſay, <hi>My Suppoſition is, that it is or may be ſo;</hi> and though the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Author adjoyns to the word Suppoſition <hi>[Tolerable]</hi> yet that aſcertains nothing, it only imports ſuch a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſufferable, that is, may be ſuffered to be a <hi>Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> not a thing that's <hi>Certain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are Aſſemblies Obvious to every Eye, that knows any thing of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which cannot on any Terms be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi> There are other Aſſemblies which have ſeveral Marks and Tokens of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> ſo far as ſeveral things outward, profeſt and acted may be ſuch; and yet notwithſtanding, not owned by the Lord as the <hi>Church of Chriſt;</hi> The preſent Age as well as Ages paſt yields many Preſidents to prove the ſame; for that 'tis Obvious there have been many Aſſemblies under various Forms, who profeſs Faith in Chriſt, Works of Righteouſneſs, and divers Truths owned by the <hi>true Church of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whether ſuch things profeſt and owned, may not be ground for a <hi>tolerable ſuppoſition,</hi> that ſuch Aſſemblies are the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> I leave to the Judgment of the impartial and Judicious reader, having this further Teſtimony to add, that the World hath too much been troubled with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, Decrees, and Deciſive Judgments of too many Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, <hi>ſuppoſed to be the Church of Chriſt,</hi> or that on <hi>tolerable Suppoſition</hi> have been ſo termed, who have rather increaſed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57559:176"/>than ended Controverſies, as Hiſtory doth at large mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
                  <p>And ſince <hi>R. B. undertakes by Reaſon to evidence the ſame,</hi> I ſhall (according to the Line of Right Reaſon and Truth) take upon me further to diſcover the Fallacy of his ſo confident Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>The Qualifications of a Member of Chriſt's Body, is <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication through the Spirit.</hi> Whereſoever any number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo qualified, are Aſſembled in Chriſts Name, there is the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> though they are of that number, who are of the loweſt Degree or Rank in the Body. Now, an Aſſembly of ſuch Members may be as Inſenſible and void of Underſtanding in many Divine Matters, and Myſteries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Kingdom of God, as the <hi>Ear</hi> of the natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be Inſenſible of what the <hi>Eye</hi> doth ſee; and ſo may have Caſes of Controverſies brought before them, whereof they are no more competent Judges (not being Gifted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Spirit) than the <hi>Eye</hi> of the natural Body is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Diverſities of Voices, and Sounds,</hi> or the <hi>Ear</hi> of <hi>Diverſities of Colours;</hi> and yet may be all Faithful in their Places, walking according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Meaſures of Grace, which God hath given them; ſo that none can in Truth ſay, ſuch an Aſſembly may not properly be called the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> being built upon him their Rock, and having perfect Fellowſhip each with other in the Life of Righteouſneſs.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To this <hi>Objection,</hi> having in my foregoing Lines uſed ſuch an Expreſſion, I thus ſay, <hi>The General Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt Born are written in Heaven,</hi> Heb. 12.23.

                     <hi>Though ſome particular Members may be liable to err, 'tis neither reaſonable nor juſt to conclude, the whole Body or Church of Chriſt is liable to err.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I ſay; God forbid that the whole <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> ſhould err; yet I ſay, neither the Light within us, nor the Scriptures of Truth without us, do evidence that any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one more than another, is by any peculiar Election ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from being liable to err, no more than Particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were from all Eternity Elected, and others Reprobated; and ſo it appears to me, <hi>that the Promiſe was not with reſpect, that ſome ſhould continue ſtill Faithful, and not liable to err, though others, being liable thereto, ſhould err; but with reſpect to every Member of the Church, whileſt eſtabliſh'd on the Rock Chriſt:</hi> ſo that not only a part of the Church, but every Member thereof, whilſt built on the Rock Chriſt, ſhall be ſo preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt any one of them; and this ſeems to me to be evident from the very Connection of the words of the Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>And upon this Rock I will Build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi> that is, againſt the Church built (and whileſt remaining) on the Rock Chriſt. But if any Aſſembly, through Unwatchfulneſs and Diſobedience, depart from the Rock Chriſt, whereon they were built, then in that State they cannot properly be called the <hi>Church built and remaining on the Rock Chriſt;</hi> and ſo having been liable to be overcome, the Gates of Hell do prevail; and therefore, though 'tis impoſſible that any one Member of Chriſt's Church, whileſt abiding in the Seed (in which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſtands, and to which the Promiſe is) can be deceived; yet notwithſtanding, I affirm, that every Member of Chriſt's Body (and if <hi>every Member,</hi> than the <hi>whole Church</hi>) is liable to err; if they wait not in, and keep not unto that, in which their Preſervation ſtands.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57559:178"/>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Watch and Pray, that ye enter not into Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> this was ſpoken not with reſpect to ſome particular Members in the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> that were lyable to err, and as if there were others that were not. And therefore its reaſonable to conclude, that all may thorough Temptation be in danger to err, if they watch not, but yet my Faith is, that a remnant will be preſerved ſo watchful, as that, being built on the Rock Chriſt, the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being duely weighed, and conſidering what great Abuſe hath been made of Scriptures that ſpeak to this purpoſe, <hi>That the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt the Church of Chriſt; and that what they bind or looſe on Earth, ſhall be bound or loos'd in Heaven;</hi> and that alſo to maintain an Antichriſtian Yoak of Bondage, under the pretence of <hi>Chriſt's Church,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That it cannot err;</hi> it appears not much more like one call'd a <hi>Quaker</hi> (if we conſult the Writings of ſome of thoſe antient and Honourable Labourers, who were Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the hands of the Lord to turn Thouſands unto the Light within us, as the unerring Guide) to treat on ſuch Scriptures (if applyed to outward and ſettled Aſſemblies, as ſuch as are not lyable to err) than a treating on this Scripture, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body;</hi> and apply it to <hi>outward bread,</hi> would. And though none amongſt the People of the Lord called <hi>Quakers</hi> (as ever I yet heard) treated on the later Scripture in Approbation of the ſenſe and application before recited; yet I find the aforeſaid Author, treating on the former Scriptures, and that (as to me appears) with reſpect to ſettled Aſſemblies (who, if they watch not, may err) which is eaſily to be ſavour'd, if the whole ſcope of his Treatiſe be but duely weighed. The ſervice for God and his Truth, in his ſo doing, at this day, is hard to be underſtood by many, who have an Honourable eſteem for Truth, as preach't in the beginning: eſpecially ſince it may occaſion many to ſtumble and fall, through a Jealouſy that thoſe Scriptures in proceſs
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57559:179"/>of time may be uſed <hi>to enforce Obedience to Outward Sentences, and Decrees relating to Conſcience, whether the Underſtanding be ſo illuminated as to ſee the ſervice of ſuch Obedience for God and his Truth, yea or nay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſince it is ſo, that of late much is ſpoken touching the <hi>Authority of the Church, and that the Church is not lyable to err, and that the Apoſtacy ſhall never enter the Generality more,</hi> it is at this time with me to treat a little further touching things of this nature; And though I would not be underſtood to ſay, that the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> is not inveſted with Power from on high (for every Member thereof according to meaſure ſtands in the Power) or that the Apoſtacy ſhall enter the General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity again; yet I have this certain ſenſe, that in Aſſerting the <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi> and her <hi>infallibity,</hi> &amp;c. time hath not been ſo well imployed, as might have been in an inward exerciſe, to be comprehended in the Power, thereby to be preſerved out of all Apoſtacies and error; but to proceed. We read that the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells them, <hi>They were come to the
<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12.13.</note> General Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt-Born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all;</hi> we do not find that the Scripture ſpeaks of the Authority of this <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> ſo that their Sentences and Deciſive Judgments ſhould be a Bond on Believers to obey, though they ſee it not: but ſaith, <hi>God is Judge of all.</hi> Neither do I find that the Scriptures make mention of any <hi>General Aſſembly of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> other than in this place: And ſince the word <hi>[Church]</hi> is moſtly uſed in Scriptures with reſpect <hi>to particular Congregations,</hi> or <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> what ground is there to exalt the Power of a <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> above any <hi>Particular one?</hi> eſpecially ſince no ſuch Aſſemblies (whether <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Particular</hi>) as Aſſemblies of men, have Power one above another, further than the Power of God appears more eminent in Degree in one, than another: <hi>for God by his Spirit alone is Sole Judge;</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing (though but through an Handmaid, or meaneſt of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57559:179"/>the Flock in the leaſt of Aſſemblies) ought to be ſubmitted to when God's Witneſs in the Conſcience Anſwers, whether an Aſſembly eſteemed <hi>a General Aſſembly</hi> approve thereof or no.</p>
                  <p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57559:180"/>Aſſembly of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> or that any part of the Church, without ſuch particular Election or Miſſion, ſhould Aſſemble together, and call themſelvs the <hi>General Aſſembly of the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Query, Whether thoſe ſo affirming, would not therein manifeſtly erre? Yet I would not hereby be underſtood to Judge it as an Evil, for any, whether Apoſtles or Elders, or any elſe, to meet together, when, where and as often as they in the Spirit ſhall find Freedom from the Lord ſo to do; nor yet, being met together, to judge them for giving forth any thing by way of Recommendation to the Conſciences of their Brethren, when they find freedom from the Lord ſo to do. Yet in this Caſe every one had need to wait in their Own Gift, that ſo they may not exerciſe themſelves in things beſide their Gifts; and then, what ſuch bring forth may have an Anſwer in the Conſciences of their Fellow-Brethren.

B.</hi> Page 63. treating of the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> which may be exerciſed by the Members of the <hi>True Church</hi> diverſly, without Judging one another, thus ſaith; <q rend="margQuotes">"There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Liberty and forbearance alſo, that is more perticular, and has a relation to the Circumſtance of Times and Places, which will not hold univerſally; the firſt was in ſuffering <hi>Circumciſion</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> the ſecond was, in <hi>Obſervation of certain dayes;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To which I ſay; The aforeſaid Author, as in other things,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57559:180"/>ſo alſo in this, is miſtaken (if he meanes that Circumſtances of Times and places, are the Ground of <hi>Chriſtian forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance)</hi> which is manifeſt from what the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 14.3, 4. <hi>Let, not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not, Jadge him that eateth; Who art thou that Judgeſt another man's Servant? To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth:</hi> which evidently ſhews, that in as much as every one muſt anſwer for himſelf, 'tis fit every one ſhould believe for himſelf, and ſo practiſe, without being <hi>impoſed</hi> upon by others. And this is the Ground of all <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Forbearance,</hi> and not <hi>Circumſtances of Times and Places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though Page 65. <hi>R. B.</hi> ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">"That is accounted a doctrine of Devils, which in another reſpect was Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an forbearance;</q> which I take him to aſſert from his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on 1 Cor. 8. throughout, and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. The latter Scripture tells us, <hi>That commanding to abſtain from Meats, is a Doctrine of Devils;</hi> that to the <hi>Corinths</hi> ſaith, <hi>If Meats make my Brother to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the World ſtandeth;</hi> This doth not in any wiſe ſhew, that <hi>a Command to abſtain from Meats</hi> was at any time, or in any reſpect Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable: for if he would have this Aſſertion paſs for Truth, he ought to have proved, not only that <hi>a Command to abſtain from fleſh,</hi> was a Doctrine of Devils, which that to <hi>Tymothy</hi> doth, but alſo that <hi>ſuch a Command</hi> was once <hi>Chriſtian Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</hi> but nothing of this latter appears, nor yet can be proved from the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
                  <p>And as to the caſe of <hi>Circumciſion, R. B.</hi> ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>'Twas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> to the <hi>Jewes</hi> for a time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I ſay, we find, that many of the believing <hi>Jewes</hi> were not come from under it; and that thoſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> who ſaw beyond it, did not condemn ſuch their Brethren: but we do not find that the Apoſtles (as perſons, that had power to <hi>permit</hi> or <hi>not permit</hi> ſuch a practice in the <hi>Church</hi>) did approve of it in any of the Jewes, or condemn the ſame in ſuch as practiſed it, until by Faith they ſaw beyond it: for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57559:181"/>as on the one hand, 'twas not in their Commiſſion to preach up Circumciſion; ſo on the other, 'twas not in their Power to be a Bond on any to forbear, who through Faith were not firſt lead therefrom.</p>
                  <p>For though the Apoſtle ſaith, Gal. 5.2. <hi>I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, if ye be</hi> Circumciſed, <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing, and Gal.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11. <hi>But now after ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the Weak and Beggerly Eliments? Ye obſerved Daies, and Months,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am afraid of you.</hi> Yet this did not at that time condemn that <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Forbearance,</hi> which the Apoſtle before approved, in and with reſpect unto ſuch, as made <hi>Couſcience of Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Obſerving Daies;</hi> for it plainly appears, he ſpoke to a People, who were redeemed out of thoſe Beggerly Eliments, and were come paſt thoſe Rudiments which is evident by theſe his words, <hi>how turn ye again?</hi> And ſo he might well exhort ſuch neither to <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe,</hi> nor yet be in the <hi>Obſervation of Daies;</hi> for that <hi>God doth not uſually lead into thoſe things, which he hath led out of;</hi> and this might well conſiſt with the Truth, even at ſuch a time and ſeaſon, when others, thorough a Conſcientious Scruple might in a plea for both, with reſpect to themſelves, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered, and that alſo we find the Apoſtle exhorting the Churches, not to be Judging one another with reſpect to things relating to <hi>Conſcience,</hi> there is great need for every one to watch againſt a Cenſorious Judging Spirit, leſt whileſt any are Judging their Brethren, they themſelves become Caſtawayes.</p>
                  <p>Having in ſome Meaſure cleared my Conſcience, I have this further to add; That 'tis a bleſſed thing for Brethren to dwell together in Love, and Unity; yet this Love and Unity ought to conſiſt in the Truth, elſe the bleſſing is not.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but there are many who are ready to conclude,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57559:181"/>
                     <hi>That an Univerſal Unity ought to be eſtabliſh't in the Churches, by the Aſſiſtance of outward Inſtruments;</hi> that as we are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Body, ſo we may not only be one in Faith, one in Doctrine, but alſo one in Practice, with relation to <hi>Diſcipline, Order</hi> and <hi>Outward Formes of Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My ſoul ſhould rejoyce to ſee that Day, wherein we might all be ſo led by the appearance <hi>of Chriſt's Spirit</hi> in us, under <hi>his Government,</hi> which ought to be exalted over all, as that this Oneneſs might thereby be witneſſed amongſt all the Families of Gods People at this Day. But ſince it is ſo with the Church of God at this day, as it was with the Church in the Primitive Dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are <hi>diverſityes of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations,</hi> and <hi>diverſityes of Gifts</hi> &amp; <hi>Operations</hi> in the Body, and yet thorough the ſame Spirit; it behoves every one diligently to watch, that we Judge not one another by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe differing exerciſes; as if theſe things conſiſted not with the Unity of the Body.</p>
                  <p>And ſince alſo it is ſo, that <hi>amongſt the primitive Believers there were ſuch as practiced Circumciſion, ſome made Conſcience of keeping a Day, and ſome that Abſteyn'd from eating Fleſh, and others that did not, and yet a Chriſtian-Liberty and Forbearance was ſo exerciſed, as that they were not to be Judging one another about theſe things, and that we find not that theſe differing exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in a Chriſtian-Liberty, did ſubject any of thoſe Believers exerciſed therein to the Cenſure of being out of the Unity of the Body;</hi> I therefere do reaſonably conclude, that the infallible Mark, whereby any Member of the Body is known to be in true Unity with the Body, doth not conſiſt in Profeſſion and Belief of certain Principles and Doctrines, and Practices depending thereon; nor yet in Obedience to the Meaſures of <hi>others;</hi> but in the <hi>Circumciſion of the heart,</hi> and an <hi>Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God,</hi> and that every Member keeps his own order, Office and Place in the Body, thorough his Obedience to the Meaſure and Gift of Grace in himſelf, which he hath received from God to Profit withal. <hi>The
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57559:182"/>moſt infallible mark and token then of a Member in the true Unity with the Body of Chriſt, is an inward inviſible mark that cannot be ſtampt on any, but by the impreſſion of Gods Power on the heart;</hi> and therefore is it, that the outward endeavours of all ſuch Chriſtian Profeſſors, as have been and are in the Apoſtacy, inſtead of attaining to an <hi>Heavenly Union in the Spirit,</hi> have at moſt but arrived to an <hi>Outward Unity,</hi> conſiſting in their Outward Conformities and Uniformities, according to the Commands, Traditions, Decrees, or Examples of Men.</p>
                  <p>When in Ages and Generations paſt, the Apoſtacy firſt entred as a Flood, I am perſwaded, that all who have known the Truth, and have had the Conſideration and true Senſe thereof upon their Spirits, do conclude, that the Cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſprang <hi>through an Inward Departure from the Anointing in themſelves</hi> (Obedience whereunto according to the reſpective Meaſures of Grace given of God, and received by each Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was a manifeſtation of that wherein the Unity of the Body ſtands) and as the Apoſtacy entered, no doubt but the <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Rudiments of Men</hi> came to be exalted; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cautioned the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Beware leſt there be any that ſpoyl you through the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men, according to the Rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt;</hi> but yet notwithſtanding, I Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any have been greater <hi>Pretenders to Unity,</hi> than thoſe who have been <hi>exalting the Traditions of Men;</hi> and ſhall leave it to the Judicious Reader to conſider, whether a ſufficient Evidence hereof appears not in divers Apoſtatiſed
<note n="*" place="margin">Note. * <hi>Men of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Spirits, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that I herein ſtrike at the</hi> true Church. <hi>God forbid I ſhould ſo do, for the true Church never exalted the Traditions and Rudiments of Men: for though the Apoſtle ſaid, in</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.15.

                  </p>
                  <p>Many of Gods People yet in the Body are Witneſſes that, <hi>one part of that Teſtimony which accompanied the Servants of the Lord in thoſe latter Days was againſt Outward Forms, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Preſcriptions, Decrees, Ordinances of men, with relation to Matters Spiritual and Divine, and wherein the Conſciences of Gods People might be concerned,</hi> as being thoſe Rudiments of the World, out of which he hath determined to gather his People (for to the Children of Light they appeared more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Nature, and Tenour of the <hi>Firſt-Covenant</hi> than the <hi>Second</hi>) and not only ſo, but to eſtabliſh his Church on the Rock Chriſt, that ſo, as they received him, they might walk in him, according to their reſpective Meaſures of Grace given them of God to profit withal, and which, as the Apoſtle declared, <hi>was ſufficient for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Inaſmuch as the Teſtimony of Truth hath been, that <hi>what God leads out of, he uſually leads not into again;</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Gods Witneſs in all Conſciences, whether an Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of <hi>Outward Orders, Preſcriptions,</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> for the Members of the Church of Chriſt to walk by, and ſubmit unto, at this Day, and wherein the Liberty of their Conſciences may be invaded (of which my meaning is no other Liberty than what the Goſpel allows) doth not ſeem to exalt that ſort of Unity, wherein the Fellowſhip of the Saints in Light doth not conſiſt, and ſo conſequently may become the means to draw the Minds of Gods People <hi>outward,</hi> and to cauſe them to look at <hi>Outward things</hi> (under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Things eſtabliſh't in the Church</hi>) more than to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing in themſelves; let Gods Witneſs in every Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Judge.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, nay; For ſuch a Plea being righteous, Sin and Iniquity (which is <hi>a falſe Liberty</hi>) cannot get ſtrength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: And though I do confeſs, the Enemy of mans Soul may make uſe thereof, as the Devil did make uſe of Scripture, when he tempted Chriſt to throw himſelf down from the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Temple, ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee,</hi> yet 'tis not reaſonable to conclude, a juſt Plea can ſtrengthen any in a fleſhly <hi>Liberty;</hi> but the Tempter may, if he prevail. However, I cannot ſee it yet to be my Duty, <hi>to ceaſe to do good, though another may pretend that thereby evil may abound;</hi> and ſince <hi>R. B.</hi> ſpeaks, Page 28. of a <hi>falſe Pretence of Liberty,</hi> and that (as I take his Lines to import) with reſpect to Diſobedience to certain things ordained, relating to <hi>Order in the Church,</hi> its with me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, <hi>What that Liberty of Conſcience is,</hi> which is according <hi>to the Goſpel.</hi> And in order thereunto, 'tis neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Goſpel is Glad-tidings of Salvation, which is not attained, but by witneſſing the end for which Chriſt was manifeſt in the Fleſh, and that was to ſave People from their Sins, hence I conclude, <hi>a Pleafor a Goſpel Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is a Plea for a Freedom of the Conſcience from Sin,</hi> and ſo conſequently, a Plea for a <hi>falſe Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is that which pleads for Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection,</hi> I am yet Senſible, that ſome may yet further thus object, <hi>The difference lies not here: for we find many who contend for</hi> Liberty of Conſcience <hi>to plead againſt all Sin; and that many, who would not have it extend ſo large as thou ſeemeſt to plead for; do alſo plead againſt all Sin; and therefore thy diſtinction doth not yet ſatisfie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this then, I thus ſay, The true Profeſſours of Religion ſay,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57559:184"/>
                     <hi>Heaven is the Mark they aim at; and that this is not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without Peace of Conſcience; and that every man muſt give an account of himſelf to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence the Law of Divine Nature teacheth us, that ſince we muſt give account for our ſelves, we ought not to be impoſed upon, but ſuffered to believe for our ſelves; and whoſoever on that ſcore (and no Evil End) claimes a <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> it ought to be granted him, and this is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Liberty, which the Goſpel allows: If then any, who deny all Pleas for Sin, reſt diſatisfied in their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces touching certain Orders ordained by ſome for the Church to practiſe, and refuſe the practiſe thereof on this ſcore, that they have no Faith touching their Service in the Church: this cannot properly be called a Plea, under a falſe Pretence of Liberty; but rather a juſt and righteous Plea, according to that Liberty <hi>of Conſcience</hi> which the Goſpel allows.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; let us all watch againſt that Spirit that would inſinuate a Belief, that we ought to follow the Commands, Traditions, and Examples of Men, when Gods Witneſs in our Conſciences anſwers not, otherwiſe ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations (though none of the ancient Labourers in the primitive gathering may either ſtand by or own the ſame) may make way for men principled as <hi>R.

                  <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <p>"THe Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt came from Chriſt with a Meſſage of Life and Salvation, with a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning the Good Will of God, and his Love to Mankind, pointing out the Way from Death to Life, from Bondage to Liberty, from Wrath and Deſtruction to Peace and Salvation. What they have ſeen, what they have felt, what they have taſted, what they have handled, what they have found redeem and deliver them, that they declare abroad to others, as they are moved, as they are ſent, as they are guided and aſſiſted.</p>
                     <p>Now that which they preach to, is <hi>Mens Conſciences in the Sight of God.</hi> They open the Truth which they know, they give their Teſtimony in the Moving, Leading, and Power of the Spirit; and they leave it to the <hi>ſame Spirit,</hi> to demonſtrate it to <hi>Mens Conſciences,</hi> as it pleaſeth. They are nothing; they can do nothing; they cannot convert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man to God; but the Power that ſpeaketh by them, the ſame Power worketh in other <hi>Mens Conſciences</hi> at its Pleaſure: And here is the beginning of the <hi>Government of Chriſt in the Heart,</hi> when his Truth carries Conviction with it to the Conſcience, and the Conſcience is drawn to yield it ſelf up to him, then he lays his Yoak upon it, and takes upon <hi>him</hi> the <hi>guiding of it:</hi> he cheriſheth it, he clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, he comforteth it, he ordereth it at his Pleaſure; and he alone preſerveth it pure, chaſt, gentle, Meek, and pliable to the Impreſſions of his Spirit; and as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is kept ſingle and tender to Chriſt, ſo his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> encreaſes therein: but as it becomes hard, or ſubject to Mens Wills, ſo <hi>another Spirit</hi> gets Dominion over it.</p>

                     <p>Therefore the great work of the Miniſter of Chriſt, is to keep the Conſcience open to Chriſt, and to preſerve Men <hi>from receiving any Truths of Chriſt as from them, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Spirit opens,</hi> or to <hi>imitate any of their Practices, further than the Spirit leads, guides, and perſwades them.</hi> For Perſons are exceeding prone to receive things as Truths, from thoſe whom they have an high Opinion of, and to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate their Practices; and ſo hurt their own growth, and endanger their Souls. For if I receive a Truth, before the Lord by his Spirit make it manifeſt to me, I loſe my Guide, and follow but the Counſel of the Fleſh; which is exceeding greedy of receiving Truths, and running into Religious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices without the Spirit. Therefore the main thing in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is to keep the Conſcience pure to the Lord, to know the Guide, to follow the Guide, to receive from him that Light whereby I am to walk, and not to take things for Truths, becauſe <hi>others ſee them to be Truths;</hi> but wait till the Spirit make them manifeſt to me; nor to run into Worſhips, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Performances, or Practices, becauſe <hi>others are led thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> but to wait till the Spirit leads me thither. <hi>He that makes haſte to be rich</hi> (even in Religion, running into Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and into Worſhips, and Performances, before he feel a true and clear Guidance) <hi>ſhall not be Innocent:</hi> nor the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs, when he comes to viſit for Spiritual Adultery, and Idolatry. The Apoſtles were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding tender in this point; for though they certainly and infallibly knew what was to be believed, yet they were not Lords over Mens Faith; but waited till he, who is Lord of the Faith, would open the way into Mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. They did not take upon them to be able to turn the Key, to let in Truth and Conviction into Mens Spirits (as men in theſe Days have been too apt to undertake) but directed them to him who had the Key, there to wait for the Conviction and Illumination of their Minds, and ſo to receive in, as they found him give forth to them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Let every man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be fully perſwaded in his own Mind:</hi> take heed of receiving things too ſoon, take heed of running into Practices too ſoon, &amp; doing what ye ſee others do; but wait for your own particular Guidance, and a Full Perſwaſion from God, what is his Will concerning you. <hi>Tho I know this to be a Truth, yet do not ye receive it, till God make it manifeſt to you;</hi> receive Truth from <hi>his Hand,</hi> ſtay till <hi>He gives it You.</hi> Indeed the main Matter in Religion, is to keep out the <hi>wrong part,</hi> the <hi>forward part,</hi> the <hi>baſtardly birth,</hi> from running into Duties, catching of Openings, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of Promiſes; and to feel the Heir born of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Seed, to whom all belongs; and the other Birth never afterwards get up above him, but be ſubdued and brought into Subjection.</p>
                     <p>Again ſayeth the Apoſtle, <hi>Take heed of doing any thing doubtingly;</hi> be not forward; be not haſty; wait for the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; wait for the Manifeſtation of the Spirit. Be ſure thou receive what thou receives in the Faith, and Practiſe what thou practiſeſt in the Faith: <hi>For whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> being an Errour from the Principle of Life, which is to guide: and thereby thou loſeſt ground, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoureſt Chriſt, and comeſt under Condemnation.</p>
                     <p>And ſo the Apoſtle warns Believers, <hi>To take heed of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another on too faſt, or of Judging one another in ſuch things as ſome of them might have Light in, others not.</hi> He that eateth, not to Judge him that did not eat; and he that did not eat, not to Judge him that did eat; yea in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Worſhip, he that obſerved a Day, and kept a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, not to Judge him that obſerved not a Day, or kept not a Sabbath: For the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were truly converted, yet were hard to be drawn off from the Obſervation of their Sabbath, and could hardly bear with the Believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were never taught to keep their Sabbath with them, but were taught to eſteem every day, and ſanctifie it to the Lord <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5. And thoſe who eſteemed every day, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to the Lord (ceaſing from Sin, and reſting to him;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57559:187"/>for under the Goſpel we are not to ſet up a new Type, but to enter by Faith into the true Reſt, which is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what the other ſignified) could hardly bear with them who obſerved a Day. Even in the Apoſtles Days, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were too apt to ſtrive after a <hi>wrong <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in Outward Practices and Obſervations, and to Judge one another <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſly in thoſe things.</hi> And mark, it is not the <hi>different Practice from one another,</hi> that breaks the Peace and the Unity; but the <hi>Judging of one another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of different Practices;</hi> he that <hi>keeps not a Day,</hi> may unite in the ſame Spirit, in the ſame Life, in the ſame Love with him that <hi>keeps a Day;</hi> and he who <hi>keeps a Day,</hi> may unite in Heart and Soul, with the ſame Spirit and Life in him who <hi>keeps not a Day;</hi> but he that Judgeth the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of either of theſe, Errs from the Spirit, from the Love, from the Life, and ſo breaks the Bond of Unity. And he <hi>that draws another to any Practice, before the Life in his own Particular lead him, does as much as in him lies to deſtroy the Soul of that Perſon,</hi> Verſ. 15. This was the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>for every one to perform ſingly to the Lord what he did,</hi> and not for <hi>one to meddle with the Light or Conſcience of another</hi> (undervaluing his Brother, or Judging him, becauſe his Light and Practices differed from his, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. of that 14th <hi>Chap.</hi>) but every one to keep cloſe to their own Meaſure of Light, even to that proportion of Faith and Knowledge which God of his Mercy hath beſtowed on them; and here is the true Unity in the Spirit, in the <hi>Inward Life,</hi> and not in an <hi>Outward <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> that was not neceſſary in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Days, nor is it neceſſary now: and that Eye which ſo dotes upon it, overlooks the <hi>one Thing</hi> which is neceſſary. Men keeping cloſe to God, the Lord will lead them on faſt enough, and give them Light faſt enough (for he taketh care of ſuch, and knoweth what Light, and what Practices are moſt proper for them) but for Men to walk on faſter than the Lord holds forth Light to them, this overturns
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57559:187"/>them, raiſing up a wrong thing in them, and the true Birth hereby comes to ſuffer, to ſhrink, and be driven back. And Oh! how ſweet and pleaſant is it to the truly Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Eye, to ſee <hi>ſeveral ſorts of Believers, ſeveral Forms of Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>School of Chriſt,</hi> every one learning their <hi>own Leſſon,</hi> performing their <hi>own peculiar Service,</hi> and knowing, owning, and loving one another in their <hi>ſeveral Places,</hi> and <hi>different Performances</hi> to their Maſter, to whom they are to give an Account, and not to quarrel with one another about their different Practices, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. For this is the true ground of Love and Unity; not that ſuch a man walks and does juſt as I do; but becauſe I feel the ſame Spirit of Life in him, and in that he walks in his Rank, in his own order, in his proper way and Place of Subjection to that; and this is far more pleaſing to me, than if he walked juſt in that track wherein I walk: nay (ſo far as I am Spiritual) I cannot ſo much as deſire that he ſhould do ſo, <hi>until he be particularly led thereto by the ſame Spirit which led me.</hi> And he that knows what it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Truths from the Spirit, and to be led into Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the Spirit, and how prone the Fleſhly Man is to make haſte, and how dangerous that haſte is, will not be forward to preſs his Knowledge or Practices upon others; <hi>but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wait patiently till the Lord fit them for the receiving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> and fear leſt they ſhould receive and practiſe <hi>too ſoon,</hi> even in that part which cannot ſerve the Lord. And this I can truly ſay concerning my ſelf, <hi>I never found my Spirit forward to draw any, either to any thing I believed to be true, or to any Practice or Way of Worſhip I obſerved or walked in,</hi> but deſired <hi>that the Power and leadings of Life might go before them;</hi> and was afraid, leſt men ſhould <hi>receive things from my hand,</hi> and <hi>not from the Lords.</hi> Yea, and this I very well remember, that when I walked in the way of <hi>Independency</hi> (as it hath been commonly called) I had more Unity with,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57559:188"/>more Love towards ſuch as were ſingle-Hearted in other Ways and Practices of Worſhip (whoſe Spirits I had ſome feeling of in the true Simplicity and in the Life) than with divers of ſuch who were very Knowing and Zealous in that way of <hi>Independency,</hi> in whom a wrong thing in the mean time had got up, which had cauſed them to ſwerve from the Life, and from the Simplicity.</p>
                     <p>So that the true <hi>Church Government being in the Spirit,</hi> and over the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as in the Sight of God, the great Care muſt be to keep it within its Bounds, that <hi>nothing elſe govern but the Spirit,</hi> and that the <hi>Government</hi> be extended only unto that which is to be <hi>Governed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Care muſt be had, that nothing <hi>Govern</hi> in the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> that nothing elſe <hi>teach,</hi> nothing elſe <hi>exhort,</hi> nothing elſe <hi>admoniſh,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,</hi> nothing elſe <hi>cut off</hi> and <hi>caſt out:</hi> Every Miniſter in the Church is to watch over his <hi>own Spirit,</hi> that it intrude not into the work of God, that it take not upon it to be the <hi>Teacher</hi> the <hi>Exhorter,</hi> the <hi>Reprover,</hi> &amp;c. And every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is to wait in that Meaſure of the Spirit which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>to feel the Goings forth of the Spirit in him that teacheth and governeth;</hi> and ſo to ſubject <hi>not to Man,</hi> but <hi>to the Lord,</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> from the <hi>Lord,</hi> to <hi>Obey</hi> the <hi>Lord.</hi> Not to know any Miniſter according to the Fleſh, but to receive and ſubmit to what comes from the Spirit, in the Spirit. Not to know <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit miniſtring in them. Paul</hi> may <hi>Err, Apollo</hi> may <hi>Err, Peter</hi> may <hi>Err</hi> and did <hi>Err,</hi> when he <hi>Compelled</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to live as the <hi>Jews,</hi> Gal. 2.14. for which <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood him to the Face, Verſ. 11 and <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo did <hi>Err,</hi> Verſ. 13. but the Spirit cannot <hi>Err:</hi> and he that keeps to the Meaſure of the Spirit in himſelf, <hi>cannot let in any of their Errors, if they ſhould Err, but is preſerved;</hi> for the leaſt Meaſure of the Spirit is true, and gives true Judgment: but he that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth never ſo great a Meaſure of the Spirit, yet if he keep not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57559:188"/>Low therein, <hi>but lifteth up himſelf becauſe thereof above his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> may eaſily <hi>Err himſelf,</hi> and <hi>draw aſide others into his Errour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Care muſt be had that the Conſcience be kept tender, that nothing be received but according to the Light in the Conſcience; the Conſcience is the ſeat of Faith; and if it be not kept cloſe to the Light, which God Lighteth there, Faith is ſoon made ſhipwrack of. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is begun in the Spirit, which keepeth out the Fleſhly Part, with all its fleſhly Wiſdom, and Reaſonings about Spiritual things: and as the <hi>begining</hi> is in the <hi>anointing</hi> ſo muſt the <hi>Progreſs</hi> be. As the Spirit begins in the Conſcience, by convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, by perſwading that, by ſetting up his Light there, and leading the ſoul by that Light: ſo that Light muſt ſtill be eyed, and according to its growth and manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Conſcience, ſo muſt the Soul ſtand ſtill, or go on.</p>
                     <p>The great error of the Ages of the Apoſtacy hath been, to ſet up an <hi>Outward Order,</hi> and <hi>Unformity,</hi> and <hi>to make Mens Conſciences bend thereto,</hi> either by <hi>Arguments of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> or <hi>by Force:</hi> but the Property of the true <hi>Church Government</hi> is, <hi>to leave the Conſcience to its full liberty in the Lord, to preſerve it ſingle and entire for the Lord to exerciſe, and to ſeek Unity in the Light and in the Spirit, walking Sweetly and harmoniouſly together in the midſt of Different Practices;</hi> yea, and he that <hi>hath Faith,</hi> and can <hi>ſee beyond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> yet can <hi>have it to him-ſelf,</hi> and <hi>not diſturb his Brother with it,</hi> but can <hi>deſcend and walk with him according to his meaſure.</hi> And if his Brother have any heavy Burthen upon him, he can lend him his Shoulder, and bear part of his burthen with him. Oh how ſweet and lovely is it to ſee Brethren dwell together in Unity! to ſee the true Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of God raiſed in Perſons, and they knowing and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another in that Image, and bearing with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother through Love, and helping one another under their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57559:189"/>Temptations and Diſtreſſes of Spirit, which every one muſt expect to meet with.</p>
                     <p>If thou art a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in Deed and in Truth, preſerve thy Conſcience pure and tender towards God; <hi>do not defile it with ſuch Religious Practices, Duties, Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as thou doſt not feel the Spirit leading thee into:</hi> for all ſuch are <hi>Idols,</hi> and exceedingly polute thee. And be tender alſo of thy Brothers Conſcience, and <hi>be not an Inſtrument to draw him unto any thing which the Lord leads him not into; but rejoyce if thou find him in Simplicity of Heart ſtartling at any thing:</hi> for if he abide here faithful, his Guide will in due ſeaſon appear to him, and clear up his way before him; but if he be too haſty, he may follow a <hi>Wrong Guide,</hi> and that <hi>Guide</hi> will never lead him aright towards the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but entangle him further and further from it.</p>
                     <p>Oh how many have run a Whoring from the Lord! how many have firſt loſt the Guidance of his Spirit, and then drowned their Life in Religions Performances! How many have Drunk of the Cup of Fornication from the Life, at the Hands of the Fleſhly Wiſdom! How many have filled their Spirit with New-Teſtament Idols and Images! How many have even hardened their Hearts and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, by following the Doctrines of Men, their imaginary Meanings of Scriptures, and the imaginations and Dreams of their own Hearts! Is it not time for men at length to turn back towards the Lord, to wait for the Viſitation and Light of his Spirit, from whom they have gone a Whoring, and whom, in all theſe things they have grieved? And if ever any feel and enjoy the Guidance of God's Spirit, their Conſcience muſt be kept tender to it, and ready to hear and follow his voice, who ſpeaks in Spirit to that which is born of him, which infallibly knowes his Voice, and (being kept clear) cannot doubt Concerning it. <hi>My Sheep hear my voyce</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) they know it, and the voice of the ſtrange Spirit they know not, ſo as to follow it, but turn
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57559:189"/>from it both in themſelves and others. But, that which is not the Sheep, but hath only got the Sheeps Cloathing, cryes out, <hi>How ſhall we know the Voice of the Spirit? we may be deceived;</hi> Nay, that which is born of God, that which is the Elect of God, cannot be deceived. Wait therefore for the Birth of the Spirit, to which the Spirit is given for a Guide, who infallibly guides it out of Deceit. All De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers are out of this Birth, out of this Spirit; perhaps in ſome Birth or other framed from the Letter, and living in the Imitation of ſome Practices and Ordinances from the Letter (under which Cover they lie in wait to deceive) but Strangers to the Life and Power, and to that Wiſdom which begets and bears to God. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> Erred, and deceived their Proſelites before the coming of Chriſt: Thus the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (in Name) have generally Erred all along the Apoſtacy, and indeed (for the Generality) have not been true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but only a <hi>perſecuted Remnant</hi> amongſt them: whoſe Life hath been nouriſhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>not by Doctrines and Obſervations, which they have been taught by the Precepts of Men,</hi> nor by the <hi>Knowledge</hi> which they themſelves have gathered, but by a little Bread, dayly handed to them from the Father of Mercies, out of the Wilderneſs: that was the thing which nouriſhed their Souls up to God, though many of them knew not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly what it was that nouriſhed them, nor how they came by it.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But is not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity lovely? and doth not the Apoſtle exhort</hi> Chriſtians <hi>to be of one Mind? and were it not a ſweet thing if we were all of one Heart and one Way?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Yea; <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> is very lovely, and to be deſired and waited for, as the Spirit of the Lord (which is one) leads and draws into one. But for the Fleſhly Part (the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57559:190"/>Wiſe Reaſoning Part of Man) by fleſhly Ways and Means to ſtrive to bring about a <hi>Fleſhly Uniformity,</hi> which <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares</hi> and <hi>overbears</hi> the <hi>tender Conſcience,</hi> this is not Lovely, nor Spiritual, nor Chriſtian. And the Apoſtle, who Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to one Mind, yet doth not bid them, <hi>force one another to one mind,</hi> but <hi>walk together ſweetly, ſo far as they had attained; and wherein they were otherwiſe minded, God in his due time would reveal more to them,</hi> Phil. 3.15, 16. <hi>He that hath, to him ſhall be given;</hi> and the Intent and Work of the Miniſtry (with the ſeveral Miniſtrations of it) is to bring into the Unity (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13.) as Perſons are able to <hi>follow,</hi> and not to <hi>force all Men into one Practice or Way;</hi> that's the way to deſtroy the Faith, and the true U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and at beſt can introduce but a <hi>Fleſhly Appearance of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity into ſuch a Form of Worſhip and Godlineſs, as eats out the Power.</hi> And for being of <hi>one Heart</hi> and <hi>one Way;</hi> Bleſſed be the Lord, this is in meaſure known and witneſſed: The Way is one, Chriſt the Truth of God; and he that is in the Faith, and in the Obedience to the Light, which ſhines from his Spirit into the Heart of every Believer, hath a taſt of the <hi>one Heart</hi> and of the <hi>one Way;</hi> and knoweth that no <hi>Variety of Practices</hi> (which is of God) <hi>can make a Breach in the true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> This is the <hi>one Way,</hi> for every one to be ſubject to the Light of Chriſts Spirit, which he hath received from Chriſt; and every one keeping here, there is alſo <hi>one Heart</hi> kept in the midſt of all the <hi>Variety,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Practices.</hi>

B.</hi> declared his meaning to be, not only with reſpect to all the Outward Orders and Forms of Diſcipline in Government amongſt us, but alſo with reſpect to the Power of God: <hi>which, being Compared with his now declared Meaning on the ſame Subject, ſhews again that he doth not by this confirm (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his pretence ſo to do) what is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the aforeſaid</hi> Letter, <hi>becauſe here is no mention made of any</hi> Outward Orders (<hi>Eſtabliſh't and Practized by the People called</hi> Quakers) <hi>and that he pretends his Meaning to be an</hi> Eſtabliſhment on the Spirit only, and ſuch as are led by it; <hi>which is a clear diſcovery of his Fallaciouſneſs and will ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſuch as may peruſe his words, whereon the</hi> Fifth Obſervation <hi>is made: for therein he pretends</hi> to give the ſame Satisfaction as is ſignified in the ſame Letter. <hi>Beſides, 'tis worthy our Obſervation, that from</hi> R. B's <hi>words,</hi> ſome Perſons are intended Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhers of the Government upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only <hi>(but yet with this Addition (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his word</hi> only) and ſuch as are led by it: <hi>which to me ſeems a</hi> two-fac'd kind of Expreſſion; <hi>for if the heart of a man be the place wherein the Laws of Chriſt are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teu, and his</hi> Government is to be exalted, <hi>and that we have</hi> no ground to expect any other Government, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to be like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſave Chriſt Jeſus by the Manifeſtation of his Spirit in us; why could not he have been contented to have ſtopt his Pen at the words [SPIRIT ONLY?] <hi>but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he makes this Addition,</hi> and ſuch as are led by it, <hi>I muſt confeſs I am in ſome meaſure at a ſtand,</hi> touching his meaning thereby, <hi>and have a</hi> Godly Jealouſie, <hi>that notwithſtanding</hi> his pretence to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that nothing done by meer Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will any thing avail; <hi>yet when it may ſerve his turn,</hi> he may from his own Lines bring forth another Concluſion, <hi>and inferr a</hi> Subjection <hi>to others, under the Notion of</hi> Governours over the reſt, <hi>and that</hi> the Dictates of the Spirit in us, muſt give way to the pretended Dictates of the Spirit in others; <hi>by which means at length it may ſo happen, that the</hi> Profeſſion of the very Principles of Truth <hi>(as held forth amongſt us in the Beginning)</hi> may be Irradicated: <hi>for if once the Day come, wherein the</hi> Faith <hi>of any is,</hi> that certain Perſons <hi>(above or diſtinct from any others)</hi> are the Men who are led by the Spirit, and that the Government of Chriſt is Eſtabliſh't on them, <hi>then in probability it will naturally follow,</hi> that inſtead of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing this Primitive Exhortation, [turn in your Minds unto the Light that ſhines in your own Conſciences] many will be turning their Minds out unto unto the Dictates of others; <hi>and were it ſo, that what</hi> R. B. <hi>aims at ſhould be granted</hi> viz. the Eſtabliſhment of Chriſts Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, on men led by the Spirit: <hi>this then might be objected,</hi> that many might pretend thereto who were not led by the Spirit, <hi>and where the</hi> Spirit of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning <hi>is wanting in ſuch as are to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, they may be in a ready and open way to</hi> Deſtruction. <hi>But on the contrary, let this undoubted Truth be held forth,</hi> viz. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one be obedient to his meaſure of Grace and Light received from God, and that the Light and Grace is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of all Sin, then there will be no Stumbling nor By-Path walked in. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>his Language in another reſpect ſeems to me inconſiſting with the Truth; becauſe the</hi> Government <hi>treated upon to be Eſtabliſh't is pretended to be</hi> Chriſt's Government, <hi>that the</hi> Eſtabliſhers, <hi>are</hi> certain Perſons <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by theſe R.

                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If any did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that by my aſſerting, the Ancient Apoſtolick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was Eſtabliſhed among us upon the Right Baſis and Foundation, I intended that theſe particular Orders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Outward Things, that were among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles either were, or were to be Eſtabliſhed among us, they did much miſtake me, for I never purpoſed any ſuch thing, but only to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57559:195"/>that by Eſtabliſhing the Government and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in and upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only, and ſuch as are led by it, we did Eſtabliſh it upon the ſame Baſis, and Foundation whereupon that Exerciſe in the Church in the Days of the Apoſtles was built: for I am far from Believing, that the moſt exact Conformity to the Order and Method of the Church in the Apoſtles Days, or even to what may be now appointed by the ſame Spirit, without the Inward Life and Virtue go along, ſignifies any thing; for I know that nothing done by meer Imitation will any thing avail in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service of God: and therefore that no Act done without Conviction will any ways be profitable to the Doer; yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not, but that ſuch as forbear to do what by the Teſtimony of God in his Servants is commanded to be performed in the Church are juſtly to be blamed, and be Judge; dtherefore in reſpect that through Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57559:196"/>and unwatchfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they have blinded themſelves from the ſight and knowledge of their duty; for if it ſhould be ſaid, no man were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for not doing that which he yet ſees not to be his duty, then no man were to be condemned who had by Iniquity and Unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs brought hardneſs and blindneſs upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for all the Iniquities be commits afterwards; and how would this tend to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh Rantiſm, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which is to bring their Conſciences to that paſs, as not to be ſenſible of any Checks? then the Nations are not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for all their Idolatry, Wickedneſs, and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that they are not ſenſible of the Evil of it: whereas Truth teaches us to believe, that had they been Faithfull to the ſmall meaſure of Light in things more obvious, it would have further opened and manifeſted other things. Then ſhould not the <hi>Jews</hi>
                              <pb n="111" facs="tcp:57559:196"/>have been condemned for crucifying Chriſt, ſince <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, they did it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, and <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, that if they had known they would not have <hi>crucified</hi> the Lord of Glory. Yea then all thoſe that perſecuted and burned the Proteſtant-Martyrs were not to be Judged for it, becauſe they ſuppoſed they did well in it, even according to Chriſt's Teſtimony, who ſays, that in killing you they ſhall think they do God good Service; ſhall men then never be condemned for doing evil or omitting their Duty, becauſe they ſee it not? what abſurdity would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereupon, may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and yet it is ſtrange that <hi>W. R.</hi> in his Papers ſhould labour ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, affirming very poſitively, that nothing ought to be given forth in the Church of Chriſt, but by way of recommendation &amp; not of command; wherein he doth either greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the matter as affirmed by me, or otherways run
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57559:197"/>into a far greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency than he is aware; for if he mean, that no man of or from himſelf only, or by vertue of any office or place he either hath or hath born in the Church of Chriſt, ought to Command any things to be performed in the Church, I freely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to it; and have aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame in very full and ample termes. But if he will ſay that no man, albeit really moved by the Spirit of God, ought to go further than a meer <hi>reomendation,</hi> it is a moſt inſolent limiting of God under a falſe pretence of Liberty, &amp; will neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that God hath not Power to command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing unleſs men be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to agree to it. For the Controverſy is here drawn to a narrow Compaſs; for he that will allow, that God hath Power to command things to be practiſed in the Church, and that thoſe Commands muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, through ſome of the Members of the Church,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57559:197"/>and that it may fall out that ſome of the Members of the Church may thorough weakneſs or unwatchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not be ſenſible they muſt either acknowledge that ſuch are to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or ſay that God hath not Power to Command, or that there is no ſuch Revelations now a Days (as do the Prieſts and Truths Enemies) or that Man is not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable for Diſobeying God, if he believe it not to be his Duty, which is as much as to ſay, that Unbelief is no Sin. Now let theſe things be ſeriouſly conſidered, how this is or can be avoided without granting the things affirmed by me; for what way the Truth can be aſſerted, the Honour and juſt Authority of God acknowledged, the neceſſity and continuance of immediate Revelation affirmed, and the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Unbelief not juſtified, and the juſt Judgement of God upon the Rebellious and Diſobedient vindicated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affirming what I have done.</p>
                           <p>And if any can do this in words more wary than I have done, I ſhall very readily agree to it.</p>
                           <p>For that things may be propoſed to the Church by way of Command, and further than a meer Recommendation, the whole Current of the Scriptures ſhews, not only to the Church among the <hi>Jews,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do propoſe the Will of God to be performed very poſitively and peremtorily; but even under the New-Covenant, as appears in the 15th. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in many places of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, particularly, that on 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14. <hi>If any Man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, note that Man, and have no Company with him that he may be aſhamed.</hi> This then being manifeſted with reſpect to thoſe times, I would know of <hi>W.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57559:198"/>of his Authority, or has left off to rule his church immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Spirit? whether ſo to affirm, be not groſſely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Ancient and Primitive Doctrine of Friends?</p>

                              <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whereas ſome did ſuppoſe that I did make the Difference in the End but very ſmall betwixt Deciſſive Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Friends and among <hi>Papiſts</hi> and other Perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſay, they place the Deciſive Judgement in the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of an Aſſembly, made up of their chief Teachers and Miniſters; and albeit I limit it not to that; yet I ſeem to affirm, That it moſt uſually is ſo conveyed, and ſo the difference only is, that they make it always ſo, and I moſt uſually. To this I anſwer, that if in Charity I may ſuppoſe this inſinuation comes not from malice, at leaſt, it proceeds from great Ignorance of the Popiſh Principles; and it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſuch to be ſilent, than to Judge of things they do not underſtand, for the Difference here is very Great and Fundamental, in reſpect both Papiſts and others do affirm, that men by vertue of an Outward ſucceſſion or vocation may have true Right to ſit and give Judgment in ſuch Aſſemblies, albeit they be void of true Holineſs, and have not the Grace of God, which they ſay, is no neceſſary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to the being of a Miniſter; ſo that they Place the Power of Judgment not onely in the plurality of Votes abſolutely (in which we differ from them) but alſo in the Judgment of ſuch as may without any abſurdity by their own Principles be ſuppoſed to be all and each of them void of the true Grace of God; and whom (even ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be Gracious, they Affirm not at all to be led by the immediate Spirit of Chriſt, which they ſay is now cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: now, can there be a greater difference than is betwixt theſe two, to wit, to affirm, that the Power of deciſion is in an Aſſembly of men (to being Members of which aſſembly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57559:198"/>the Grace of God is no neceſſary qualification) and who deny any ſuch thing, as to be immediately led by the Spirit of Chriſt, as a thing not attainable in theſe Dayes, and yet that all Chriſtians muſt be Subject to what the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of ſuch an Aſſembly ſo Conſtitute do determin.</p>
                           <p>And to Affirm that the Power of Deciſion is onely and alone in the Spirit, not neceſſarily tied to a general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, but if it pleaſe God to make uſe of ſuch an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, yet neither to the Plurality of them, but in and thorough ſuch of his Servants, as he ſees meet, and that none are capable, or can be ſuppoſed to be Members of ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, or eſteemed ſuch from whom ſuch a Judgment can be expected, or ought to be received, unleſs they be men in whom the Grace of God, not onely is, but has truly wrought to mortify and regenerate them in a good Meaſure, in whom the Judgment of Truth really proceeding from the Spirit will be manifeſt, to all who are Truly Faithful, who will accordingly ſubmit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, not with reſpect to the Men, but the Authority of God manifeſted in and thorough them; ſo that ſuch as ſee not this Judgment aright will be Juſtly Condemnable of God for their not ſubmitting: Not as if they ſhould be accepted of God if they did obey, before conviction, but becauſe they brought this Blindneſs upon themſelves thorough the unfaithfullneſs and unwatchfullneſs, which renders them both guilty of the Blindneſs, and of the Diſobedience occaſioned by it.</p>

B. <hi>but conſidered that in this his very Poſtſcript</hi> he Renders it abſurd to conclude that men ſhould not be Condemned for ommiting their Duty, becauſe they ſee it not, <hi>and that in his Book of Government he ſaith,</hi> neither will the pretences of any contradicting them, or refuſing to ſubmit, on the account they ſee it not, excuſe them of being guilty of diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. <hi>Me thinks then he would have forborn to Judge me as aforeſaid: and though he ſignifies that I make a Digreſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the</hi> Second Daies Meetings <hi>in</hi> London, <hi>I ſay it cannot Properly be called a Digreſſion, ſince 'tis Matter of Obſervation on ſuch as were concerned in the Approbation of</hi> R.B<hi>'s</hi> Book of Government: <hi>beſides</hi> Robert Barclays <hi>Diſingenuity is apparent in ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I Judge the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>and yet ſayeth not wherein: I ſhall therefore cite the Matter occaſioned him falſly to affirm that I Judge the Apoſtle, my words are theſe: The</hi> Scripture <hi>R. B. quotes, is</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19, 20. <hi>which thus ſayeth,</hi> Holding Faith and a good Conſcience which ſome having put away, concerning Faith have made Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, of whom is <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to Blaſpheme. <hi>Having thus repeated</hi> Pauls <hi>words, I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in theſe words.</hi> What's this to the Purpoſe to prove that the Poſitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Deciſion of the Church in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conſcience, may bind Believers; 'tis ſo remote from it, that it needs no Explanation to ſhew it ſo; nay, I may reaſonably query, whether this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be (to ordinary Capacities) plaine to the purpoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf intends, for if we counſult the Light, it doth not tell us, that a Delivery to Satan may be an Expedient whereby to learn not to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phem if by the Word Satan is meant the Devil, as is uſually underſtood. <hi>I now query of</hi> R. B. <hi>whether the Delivery of a</hi> Tranſgreſſour <hi>to the Devil be according to his Light, the way to learn not to Blaſphame? if not, his</hi> Reflection on me, <hi>that I Judge the Apoſtle, is</hi> unjuſt <hi>and</hi> abſurd.</note> as his own Letter ſignifies, the Superſtructure falls of it ſelf, as not touching my Intention, nor yet reaching me; but onely that <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion</hi> he ſuppoſed to be my <hi>meaning,</hi> and to follow from my words, for which end he oftentimes is ſo wary of as to affirm in his Papers, that to his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding my <hi>words</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to import, and my <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſeems to be <hi>ſo,</hi> in which things ſince himſelf ſaw, and I have manifeſted his <hi>Miſtake:</hi> I am not ſo great <hi>a Lover of Centention,</hi> as to buſy either my ſelf, or mind of others with the <hi>Men of Straw of his Making;</hi> but yet he was not ſo modeſt, nor kind to his Old Friend, but that ſometimes he does ſeek to render my words <hi>Odious,</hi> albeit the <hi>Miſtake</hi> be <hi>his own,</hi> by reiterate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57559:199"/>repeating that of the <hi>tolerable Suppoſition</hi> of a Church at every turn above twenty times, but alſo he very obviouſly wreſts my Words, and ſeeks to impoſe upon me a <hi>Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Meaning,</hi> that he may furniſh himſelf on Occaſion there-after the more liberally to ſmite at me; as where from the Apoſtles Words, ſaying, <hi>And we have Confidence, ye will do the things we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you,</hi> &amp;c. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, where he deſires thoſe to whom he writes, to ſubmit themſelves to <hi>ſuch as Rule over them,</hi> did inferr <hi>that ſome did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and ordain ſome things, and that there lay an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in point of Duty on others to obey;</hi> upon which W.R. very unfairly obſerves, <hi>It is to be doubted his meaning is, others ought to obey, whether they ſee it their Duty, yea or nay.</hi> I leave ſuch Dealing to the Readers Judgment: ſurely it is not anſwerable to that Candor and Juſtice that <hi>W. R.</hi> lays claim to. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe <hi>W. R.</hi> in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers hath taken Occaſion to extend himſelf in long Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions upon other Matters, not treated upon in that Book, and takes oft occaſion to inſinuate his <hi>Jealouſies of Perſons and Things,</hi> that I meddled not with; as where he makes a large Digreſſion, which takes up ſeveral Pages,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57559:200"/>concerning the <hi>Conſtitution of the Second-Days Meeting at London,</hi> endeavouring what he can to repreſent the <hi>hurt</hi> and <hi>abuſe</hi> of it; and where he divers times inſinuates, <hi>that ſome are uſurping, or ſeeking to uſurp a Juriſdiction over the Conſciences of the Brethren; and that ſome do believe, that God hath raiſed up ſome outward Perſon to be amongſt the Children of Light at this day, as</hi> Moſes <hi>was of old among the Children of</hi> Iſrael, &amp;c. <hi>And that ſome do lead many into a temptation to run beyond their Line, by procuring a multitude of hands to confirm what is given forth by one, or at leaſt by a very few,</hi> with divers other things of this kind, which takes up no ſmall part of his Papers: Now theſe things are not pertinently brought in againſt me, nor would I judge my ſelf leſs impertinent to enlarge in a Conteſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, which do not immediately concern the thing under Debate; ſince the Perſon or Perſons aimed at by him in theſe Reflections, may take Occaſion, as they find it their Place to Anſwer, and perhaps may have had Opportnity to have diſcourſed with him divers of theſe things ere this time upon other occaſions. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſince a conſiderable part of <hi>W. R's</hi> Papers is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up to Evidence, as he pretends, impertinent Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I make of the ſeveral Paſſages of the Apoſtles, which he thinks I have been too curious to collect, that make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words, <hi>Order, Rule, Command</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> how he evinces that, I leave to the ſerious Reader, being the more willing to bear his Reflections in that reſpect, that he is ſo bold, when he cannot Compaſs his matter otherwiſe, not only to cenſure me, but the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. mentioned by me, that it is not only to the Purpoſe intended by me but that it is not plain to the purpoſe <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf intended (at leaſt to ordinary Capacities) adding, <hi>that the Method there propoſed by the Apoſtle anſwers not that which the Light within tells us,</hi> ſince
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57559:200"/>ſince then the Light he follows is ſuch as finds fault with the Apoſtles Aſſertions, I may the more patiently bear his affirming mine to be Erronious; and whereas <hi>W. R.</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make it appear that the Scriptures brought by me to prove a Power of Deciſion in the Church, do not affirm any ſuch thing, becauſe in theſe Scriptures there is no mention made of the Churches Diviſion, yet if he conſider that thoſe places do ſpeak (of the <hi>Seperating from</hi> and <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off</hi> of Divers Perſons <hi>Forſaking their Fellowſhip</hi>) to the Saints, who make up the Church of Chriſt, it neceſſarily preſuppoſes a Judgement of the Church, or Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Perſons for which they are ſo cut off, from the Fellowſhip of the Body of Chriſt, which is his Church.</p>

And Perhaps he may terme it as an evidence that I therein built that which I deſtroyed, when I ſaid, we find the Apoſtles Exhorting the Churches not to he Judging one another, with reſpect to things relating to Conſcience. But an Inference will not hold, unleſs I had alſo declared, that if he, or any Believer like mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, ſhould Practice according to ſuch a Judgment they were then to be condemned: but that I have not done, for ſhould I ſo have done, his conſtruction of my Building up and Pulling Down might have held; but I am ſo far from being of ſuch a Cenſorious Spirit, as that I think 'tis rather his Duty</hi> (whileſt ſo principled) <hi>to referre any ſuch Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ariſing between him, and another Friend unto the Deciſion of the Church.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57559:201"/>not the Work it ſelf imply a manifeſt Contradiction, ſo his very Writing Contradicts the matters that he writes of, and pleads for, eſpecially ſince he not onely makes ſome General Cenſure of me, and many others Profeſſing the ſame fundamental Truths with him, but is very partricular and Peremptory, yea inſinuating accuſations, as if I in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intended to make way for an Authority to Rule over at leaſt ſome of my Brethren, as his very Concluſion intimates, and in Divers other Places may be obſerved; and it will aggravate this Injury done by him the more, that the Reader may Obſerve as well in his own Letter, as in what is above mentioned, that this his cenſure was Built upon his own miſtakes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Here now follows</hi> William Rogers <hi>his own Letter concerning this Matter, and the Judgment of the Brethren, who were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to what paſt between him and me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On which I obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Brethren giving the Judgement, were but a part of the Meeting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the ſaid Letter is pretended to be mine, though I never ſigned any Letter or Paper, whereof what he hath given forth is Copy. Yet muſt confeſs, that when at that Meeting he declared himſelf by the words of his mouth to be otherwiſe principled than I know his Book doth teach, I did intend the beſt I could (with a clear Conſcience) to ſend forth amongſt Friends of my own accord, the moſt Favourable account of him and that Meeting as I could, that ſo (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) breaches, then broken forth amongſt Friends, might be healed: but of this more anon, when I come to make my Obſervations on the aforeſaid Letter, and Judgment: yet at preſent I think it proper, before I cite the ſaid Letter and Judgement to notifie the Reader, that by the little added thereto it appears that <hi>R. B.</hi> hath ſent it abroad; and foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in the ſaid Letter 'tis ſignified in theſe words, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though</hi> Robert Barclay <hi>hath given theſe Explications of his meaning, yet the very Explications (as he ſayeth) are to be found in his Book;</hi> 'tis rational to conclude, that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> (if he was then to be believed) was then principled as the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57559:202"/>declared him to be; and how his Poſtſcript will now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak his Credit, I know not, ſince he therein doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf principled according to the Expliations, given in the ſaid Letter of his words; notwithſtanding in the ſaid Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript he thus declares, <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>And albeit theſe things, which were chiefly ſcrupled at by any, be ſufficiently cleared by</hi> W. R's <hi>own Letter, yet that all may be ſatisfied in having them from my own hand, I am free to ſignifie thus as to them.</hi>
                     </q> From theſe words what rational man could have expected leſs than a Confirmation of the Senſe given in the ſaid Letter; but how remote he is from that, I doubt not but will be ſufficiently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every impartial underſtanding Reader, that on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of the ſaid Letter (hereafter-cited) his Poſtſcript, and the annexed Obſervations will give them all but their due weight: and if thereto they add a due conſideration of his <hi>Book of Government,</hi> no Queſtion but he will then appear like a man with three Faces, having on the Sheeps Clothing in the midſt of a briery Thicket, who wileſt, ſtriving to get out thereof, is the more and more entangled.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57559:203"/>aſſerted by me;</hi> (meaning his Book of Government) <hi>but have the Teſtimony and Approbation of Gods Light and Spirit in my Heart, for my Work and Service in that Matter.</hi> For my own part I am perſwaded that the Law of Charity is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with no ſuch Rules, as to prompt any rational Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Conſcientious man to conclude, that <hi>R.

                     <p>Foraſmuch as <hi>William Rogers</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> hath lately written a Manuſcript againſt a Book of <hi>Robert Barclays,</hi> Entituled, <hi>The Anarchy of the Ranters,</hi> and approved at the Second days Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> and hath diſperſed his Manuſcript in Several Parts of this Nation, without ſo much as firſt giving either to the ſaid <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> in Particular, or the Second Days Meeting in General, any account of his Scruples, or Diſſatisfaction concerning the ſaid Book of <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> contrary to all Rules of Brotherly Love, Chriſtian-Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, Goſpel-Order, and the Exemplary Practice of the Church of Chriſt, to the Defamation of the ſaid <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> the great Derogation from the Chriſtian Authority, of the ſaid Meeting, and the general Diſ-ſervice to Truth, eſpecially being ſent unto Perſons, who at preſent are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to the preſent Unity of the Body of Friends. And whereas on the Seventh Day of the Fourth Moneth 77.

                     <p>KNowing that of late there hath been ſpread abroad amongſt Friends a Paper ſubſcribed by <hi>Charles Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi> and 36 Perſons more, together with another, to which my Name is only inſerted, both relating to <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> and my ſelf, and that on Occaſion of a Free Meeting had in the City of <hi>London,</hi> wherein ſome Particulars contained in <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Book of Government (to part whereof I writ an Anſwer) were diſcourſed between <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> and other Perſons on the one part, and my ſelf on the other part: and that many falſe and wrong Conſtructions are made thereof, whereby I perceive the Simple may be enſnared, I am now on the behalf of Truth concerned thus to Inform the Reader.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> and my ſelf did agree, That twelve Perſons nominated between us ſhould have a hearing of the Matter, with this Exception made by <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> That he would not ſo limit, as not to have Liberty to add two or three others, giving this reaſon, that he expected ſome Friends to the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I told him to this purpoſe, 'twas probable I would not deny the addition of two or three Friends, if he ſhould requeſt it of me; accordingly he did requeſt it of me, and I granted it: but notwithſtanding many others came at the appointed time, who were not choſen by us, nor yet was there any Aſſent of mine (or Deſire of <hi>R. B's</hi> as I know of) that they ſhould be preſent: whereupon I refuſed to meet with them that Day.</p>
                     <p>After Friends perceived that I would not meet with them, not choſen,

                        </note> an Eminent Preacher, who ſtood by <hi>R. B's</hi> Book, told me in words to this effect,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57559:206"/>that they would not aſſent to a Meeting limited to <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay's</hi> nor my Choice; but as a Church would keep their Authority; and not only ſo, but would vindicate every word in <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Book: Conſidering the Station the ſaid Perſon is in, and how much he is eſteemed by <hi>George Fox;</hi> and that he ſeems to be the right hand man for that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment contended for by <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> I eaſily perceived my Cauſe was already Judged, and that 'twas in vain to expect a Meeting whereof I might have the choiſe of one half; but yet notwithſtanding, leſt they ſhould reflect upon me, as a Perſon afraid to ſtand to that Cauſe I was ingaged in, and having Faith in God I ſhould be preſerved, I the next Day freely and of my own accord, gave notice to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barclay, George Fox,</hi> and others of my readineſs to meet with any Friends, and ſo a free Meeting was had between <hi>R. B.</hi> and my ſelf in the preſence of <hi>George Fox, Charles Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> and Divers others.</p>
                     <p>When the debate between us was over, <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> propoſes to this purpoſe, to have ſome Satisfaction for the wrong I did him. I told him to this effect, I wronged him not, and that neither my ſelf, or any other was capable in this Caſe to do him ſo much right, as he was capable to do himſelf, by writing a Poſtſcript to his Book; this being a reaſonable Propoſal of mine, the Meeting did approve of his writing a Poſtſcript, and withall counſelled me to call in my Manuſcript in Anſwer; which I neither did, have, or can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto; but told <hi>George Fox</hi> and many more publick Friends, that if I ſhould in that reſpect take their Counſel, before I ſaw it my Duty, I ſhould manifeſt my ſelf a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hypocrite.</p>
                     <p>The Reader may alſo take notice, that in much haſte I drew up a few Lines, with intent to have ſent it of my own free will to ſome Friends, by way of Epiſtle, and to have given it under my own Hand: theſe two following Conſiderations were the motives thereto.</p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:57559:207"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Charity oblieged me to have a Regard to <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Teſtimony, as a Publick Perſon, ſince he hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declared himſelf otherwiſe principled, than I ſay, his Book doth plainly teach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since there hath been ſome Debate between us, I thought it neceſſary to inſert ſome of thoſe things whereof we debated, that ſo thoſe who had heard the Fame of his Book, and my Anſwer, might take Occaſion from thence to examine, whether <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Senſe and Explications by word of mouth were agreeable to his Book, or no: and alſo to inſert ſo much therein, as to manifeſt that <hi>Robert Barclayes Cauſe</hi> was not right, which to every diſcerning Eye cannot but appear from the ſaid Paper, though ſuch who eſpouſe <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Cauſe, may by their ſmooth Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes deceive the Simple thereby.</p>
                     <p>And when I had written what was in my mind, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, eminent Preacher being alone with me urges Divers Alterations and Additions, and after I was on Horſe-back, departing the City, deſired me to give him that ſo raced and interlined Paper (but not manifeſted his intent to Publiſh the ſame) to whom I Anſwered, I would not, unleſs he would promiſe me to ſend it me without the leaſt Alteration, or Addition of a Title, which he then Solemnly promiſed, but is not yet performed, and ſo the ſpreading of that Paper or any Paper under the notion of Copy thereof in my Name, without my Privity or Aſſent, was very Abuſive, and I can account it little better than forgery. For <hi>my Memory is ſo good as to know, that my Hand was never to any Paper, whereof this given forth in my Name is Copy.</hi> And foraſmuch as the ſaid Pretended Letter declares nothing of Error contained in my Anſwer, therefore the force of the ſaid Anſwer is nothing abated thereby.</p>
                     <p>And now if that very Paper which is ſent abroad under my Name, without my Aſſent, were ſent by me: for the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57559:207"/>ſakes of ſuch who may miſconſtrue the ſame, I thus Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                     <p>'Tis therein thus ſaid; <hi>I am ſatisfied that</hi> Robert Barclay <hi>is not Principled ſo as I and others have taken his Book to Import. And in another place, as I, and many, by ſome Paſſages in his Book, took him to be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The words ſpoken by <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> himſelf unto me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Friends, manifeſted that he is not principled as his Book teacheth, and therefore I hope none will abuſe my Charity, in believing the words of <hi>Robert Barclays</hi> mouth rather than what his former Writing ſaith, <hi>my ſo doing doth not import that I miſtook his Book; for I Affirm, that his Book is Erronious, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him otherwiſe Principled than the words of his mouth import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Again in the ſaid Paper 'tis thus ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In Particular he doth declare, That his Book teacheth not that the Church of Chriſt hath Juriſdiction over the Outward Concernes of Friends in caſe of Difference, without aſſent of the Differing Parties, and that it was far from his Intentions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to this I thus ſay, I hope none will read ſo carleſly as to conclude, that <hi>becauſe I ſay, He doth Declare,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore they will conclude that I do ſo declare.</hi> If I ſhould have ſo ſaid, I ſhould have egregiouſly wronged my Conſcience becauſe I knew not where to find ſuch an Explication of his words, this Sentence was inſerted to tell Friends what he ſaith, and not what I ſay. And ſo every one hath liberty to ſearch his Book that they may ſee whether he ſpeaketh Truth, or no, for I now poſitively Affirm, having ſince ſearched his Book again, that there is not any one Word or Sentence to be found thorough all his Book, that doth in the leaſt meaſure import that his Book doth ſo teach as he ſaith it doth, and yet ſince my departure from <hi>London</hi> he had the Confidence (or rather I may ſay the Impudence) to Affirm that Forty Brethren had given it as their ſenſe, that it did ſo teach: whenas it appeared that many of the Meeting who alſo had put their hands to the account given of the Meeting as aforeſaid, were not Principled that it ought ſo to teach, as <hi>R. B.</hi> ſaith it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57559:208"/>doth, and being for the ſatisfaction of many deſired to ſhew the Sentence that ſo imported, he refuſed ſo to do; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the real Reaſon of his ſo doing was guilt upon his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for that he could not tell where to find it.</p>
                     <p>I alſo find in the ſaid Paper, that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> in one place Affirms to this purpoſe, <hi>That there never will, nor can be wanting, in caſe of Controverſy the Spirit of God to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thorough ſome or other in the Church of Chriſt, ſo long as any aſſembly can properly, or in any tolerable ſuppoſition be ſo term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that he Declares the Words are ſound,</hi> and ſo he hath concluded as the ſaid Paper imports, <hi>That 'tis diſobedience to God, not to ſubmit to the ſentence of ſuch Aſſemblies, though the Perſons refuſing to ſubmit pretend they ſee it not.</hi> Here alſo I cannot but Obſerve, That 'tis unreaſonable for any to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that I Judge the Sentence ſound; for I teſtifie, 'tis Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and never aſſented or thought it otherwiſe, and that there is no conſiſtency in Truth between that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be his further meaning thereon, and the words in his Book. Which cannot but appear by comparing his further meaning in the ſaid Letter, and his Book together.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid Paper doth further manifeſt, that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> thus in his Book aſſerted, <hi>viz. That the Antient Apoſtolick Order of the Church of Chriſt is re-ſtabliſht on its Right Baſis and Foundation, and that his meaning therein was not onely with reſpect to all the Outward Orders and Forms of Diſcipline in Government amongſt the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>but with Reſpect to the Power of God, which is the Great Order of the Goſpel, and that though</hi> Robert Barclay <hi>hath given theſe Explications of his meaning, yet the very Explications, as he ſaith, are to be Found in his Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the Judicious Reader Conſider, whether this can any way credit <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> or the Second Dayes Meeting, that approved his Book; as evidence that it cannot, I ſay, that all the Outward Orders and Forms of Diſcipline in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do not appear to be the Antient Apoſtolick Order of the Church of Chriſt, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57559:208"/>that I have ſufficiently evidenced in my Anſwer, and if ſo, how can his Meaning be according to truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis true that the Power of God is the great Order of the Goſpel, and is of ability to Eſtabliſh us, but we not of ability to Eſtabliſh it; and therefore whatever <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> may ſay, 'tis not rational to conclude, that according to his Meaning (when he writ that Sentence) it had Relation to any thing but Outward Orders, and Forms of Diſcipline in Government; and as to his ſaying that the very Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are to be found in his Book, I Affirm, on a further Diligent Search, that there is no ſuch Explications to be found therein; and I hope thoſe who have a concern on their Spirit for Truth, will do me ſo much Right, as to Examine his Book, ſince the Caſe by the ſpreading of the ſaid Paper under my Name is brought to a narrow iſſue, for now 'tis eaſily to be manifeſted, whether herein I have wronged <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> or whether <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> is not wrong, and the Second Dayes Meeting too, whil'ſt they Juſtify and own his Book.</p>
                     <p>In the ſaid Paper 'tis thus further ſaid, <hi>viz. This further lies upon me to ſignify unto you, on behalf of</hi> Robert Barclay, <hi>I am ſatisfied that he is not Principled, as I and many by ſome paſſages in his Book took him to be; and ſince it is ſo that many have taken an offence againſt him for that cauſe, and as may be doubted even ſo far, as to reject his Teſtimony and Service for the Truth, it lies upon me as my Duty even for his and the Truths Sake to warn all, that they take heed not to entertain a prejudice againſt his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony on Jelouſies that may enter on the ſcore of any apprhenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or miſtakes of his Book, and that Anſwer that I have given thereto; but rather in an unprejudiced Spirit to wait on the Lord, to feel and Savour his Teſtimony, even as if the occaſion taken had never been.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Caution plainly appears to be written on this Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table foot, that would be unjuſt to meaſure his preſent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57559:209"/>in publick, by his Errours in his Book, or from Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſyes or miſtakes of any kind whatſoever. And as to theſe words, any apprehenſions or miſtakes of his Book, and that Anſwer I have given thereto, it doth not follow that I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took or Miſapprehended his Book: for had I ſo done, I would plainly have confeſt the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid Paper, as I am Informed, is termed my Paper of Condemnation; this I ſuppoſe is taken from theſe words that I find written therein, viz. <hi>I do freely confeſs that inaſmuch as I Publiſht</hi> my Book, before I gave <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> notice of my Objections, and Intentions therein, I acted in that reſpect not according to Goſpel Order, but am Juſtly worthy of Blame therein; as to this I have this to ſay, that though I confeſs my ſelf Blame worthy, &amp; not acting ſo civil as became me to my acquaintance, for that I writ not to him that I In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Anſwer his Book, yet I in no reſpect took Blame to my ſelf more than ſo; and to ſpeak the Naked Truth, I, rather took more Blame to my ſelf than the Caſe did require, being no way inclined to Extinuate that which I thought was not ſo Civil as became me, I dare not ſay evil, for I really thought that he was in <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſo knew not where to write to him when I intended to Anſwer ſome Paſſages in his Book, but yet alwaies did and ſtill do Juſtific the ſpreading abroad of my Anſwer, and that I had no Obligations to ſend him a Copy thereof, ſince all the Copyes I had Leiſure to write were little enough to clear my Conſcience, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to undeceive thoſe, who either were or might be deceived by his Book. And if by that eminent Preacher's aforeſaid earneſt Preſſing to alterations (at a time when I gave not my ſelf up to diſcourſe with any) there be any ſuch Word as not according to Goſpel Order, I muſt ſay, that Word is rather the Word of that other Perſons, than any thing freely coming from me. For I muſt ſay again, I am not conſcious of any Blame, unleſs my not writing a few Lines to <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> to ſignify my Intentions, may be termed blame
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57559:209"/>worthy for his Indeavours (if he ſhould have been ſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to call in his Book, would not have Obſtructed my writing that Anſwer I did, becauſe his Book was ſo ſpread that 'twas out of his Power to call them in: and inaſmuch as this Book could not be ſo Properly called a Particular Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt me as a Reproach to the Truth in General and the Profeſſion thereof: I cannot account my ſpreading an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to detect the Errours a breach of Goſpel Orders, though not ſent to him firſt. Beſides, tis Obſervable, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid account, given by <hi>Charles Marſhall</hi> and <hi>Thirty ſix Perſons more</hi> on this occaſion, ſignifies nothing of my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have acted contrary to Goſpel-Order.</p>
                     <p>And as to the Paper given forth by <hi>Charles Marſhall</hi> and Thirty Six other Perſons, I have this to ſay, that 'tis hereby manifeſt that the <hi>Second Days Meeting</hi> in <hi>London</hi> approved <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Book of Government, and ſo conſequently are Approvers of the Errour and Falſe Doctrine therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>That his Book is <hi>Erroneous</hi> and doth contain <hi>Falſe Doctrine,</hi> I ſufficiently manifeſted, and is more largely treated on in my Anſwer; and if it appeared not to the Meeting, as they ſay it did not, I am ſorry it ſhould be ſo: but I know it did appear to ſeveral of the Meeting: and yet I muſt confeſs, I wonder not at ſuch a Teſtimony, ſince I certainly know ſome of the Subſcribers of the ſaid Paper, have been exerciſed ſo much to preach <hi>Falſe Doctrine</hi> for <hi>Sound,</hi> as that I account ſuch improper Judges of what is <hi>Falſe Doctrine,</hi> and what <hi>Sound:</hi> and as to the reſt not ſo accoſtomed, I hope 'tis no worſe than the Fruit of their dull hearing, or want of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. However my great Satisfaction is, that every unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Perſon hath Opportunity to inform himſelf by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Peruſal of <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Book, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giving Credit to them or me, barely becauſe we ſo affirm.</p>
                     <p>And whereas they thus ſay, <hi>And hath diſperſed his Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57559:210"/>in ſeveral parts of this Nation, without ſo much as firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving either to the ſaid</hi> Robert Barclay, <hi>or the</hi> Second Days Meeting, <hi>any Account of his Scruples, contrary to all Rules of Brotherly-Love, Chriſtian-Fellowſhip, Goſpel-Order, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Practice of the</hi> Church of Chriſt, <hi>to the Defamation of the ſaid</hi> Robert Barclay, <hi>the great Derogation from the</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Authority <hi>of the ſaid Meeting, and the General Diſſervice of Truth.</hi> If by this they mean, that my ſending abroad my Manuſcript was contrary to the Rules of Brotherly-Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I utterly diſown that Teſtimony, as <hi>Erroneous;</hi> for I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, both by Word and my Manuſcript, that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barclay's</hi> Book is <hi>Erroneous,</hi> containing falſe Doctrine, and inaſmuch as 'twas Publickly ſpread abroad, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God and Truth, a Concern for the Truth came upon me to diſcover that <hi>Errour,</hi> that the Souls of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not be deceived; and Inaſmuch as I knew, that had he been willing to call in his Book, yet it could not take off the Obligation on me (for 'twas out of his Power to call them all in, being ſo publickly diſperſed) I thought it not my Duty to give him, or the <hi>Second-Dayes Meeting</hi> Copy thereof firſt: yet as ſoon as my leiſure permitted, I ſent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to <hi>London,</hi> directed to <hi>Steven Criſp</hi> and another publick Perſon, that ſo when I came to <hi>London</hi> (as afterwards I did) they might (if I had comitted any Errour therein) have treated me according to the merit thereof: but when I came to <hi>London no one accuſed my Anſwer as erroneous in any Reſpect,</hi> and if there was any neglect to peruſe it, 'twas their Fault, and not mine, ſince there was Opportunity for the ſaid Subſcribers to view it; for I manifeſted, that I had it with me at the Meeting held as aforeſaid, and though I deſired the Priviledge to make uſe of it, before the Meeting, to help my Memory, even as <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> made uſe of his, yet being then deſired to forbear, I made no uſe thereof at the Meeting. However, if they have this to ſay, it was their Duty to have peruſed it before they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57559:210"/>had given a Judgement that my diſperſing the ſaid Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to the Defamation of the ſaid <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> the great Derogation of the Chriſtian Authority of the ſaid Meeting, and General Diſſervice of Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I certainly know all that gave that Judgment, had not then peruſed it.</p>
                     <p>And as to their ſaying, <hi>'Twas to the great Derogation of the Chriſtian Authority of the ſaid Meeting (meaning the Second Daies Meeting)</hi> I have this to ſay.</p>
                     <p>That I never underſtood, that Friends owned any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in any of our Meetings, <hi>as a Chriſtian Authority,</hi> but the Power of God, which is Inviſible, and cannot be diminiſhed; and therefore I may well query, whether 'tis not Great <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in any to conclude, that I am capable to do any Action, which can either leſſen, diminiſh, or take from that <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> and I hope none of the ſaid <hi>Subſcribers</hi> are ſo remote from Truth, and a good Underſtanding as to conclude, that the <hi>Second Dayes Meeting</hi> hath any Authority given them by Man; but if any ſhould be ſo Weak, I muſt tell ſuch, that as I never gave it any, ſo am wholly uncapable by writing to leſſen it, if they have any.</p>
                     <p>And whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>that the Objections of the ſaid</hi> William Rogers <hi>lay not ſo much againſt the Matter and Subſtance of the ſaid</hi> Robert Barcly's <hi>Book, as againſt the way of Expreſſing ſome Paſſages therein.</hi> This I ſay is untrue, my Objections were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>very Matter</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of ſome things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Book.</p>
                     <p>On the whole matter I have this to ſay, I could not obtain a Meeting of Friends to be choſen by <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> and my ſelf, though the Perſon immediately concerned; which agrees not with the Examples of the Scriptures of Truth, Read <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1, 2. And that the aforeſaid Eminent Preacher, as the Mouth of others, under the Notion of the Church, Obſtructed; and though in the Meeting held, Friends Deportment was grave, orderly, and inoffenſive, as to me ward whilſt the debate
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57559:211"/>on my Objections held, yet I am greatly ſatisfied, that by the Publication of the ſaid two Papers, every Impartial Reader, that will be at the paines ſeriouſly to weigh the ſaid Papers, this Anſwer, and <hi>Robert Barcaly's Book</hi> and Poſtſcript, may eaſily diſcern the <hi>Errour</hi> of <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> and <hi>Charles Marſhal,</hi> with the Thirty Six ſubſcribers, but thoſe who will have an Eye to Papers and Bookes for the Writers Sakes, more then for the matters Contained therein, may in time come to have their Underſtanding ſo Vailed, as to be brought to worſhip Images, and to eſteem

                  <head>The FOURTH PART OF THE Chriſtian-Quaker Diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Apostate and Innovator,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>THis ſmall <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is chiefly deſigned to be Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto thoſe, who profeſs the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Son of the Eternal <hi>God,</hi> by his Light in the Conſciences of the Sons and Daughters of Men, to be a ſufficient Guide unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Life: The Faith of ſuch is, That thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Appearance, (or Gift of <hi>God</hi>) ſo as to Live and Walk according to the Divine Motions and Dictates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhall come to know the Salvation of <hi>God,</hi> through <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> their Law-giver, Lord, and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>'Tis publickly known, that this Principle of Truth hath been held forth, and owned by thoſe, who (in Deriſion) have been called <hi>QUAKERS;</hi> of whom it may be now ſaid, (to the great Grief, and Exerciſe of the Spirit of the Faithful Followers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> amongſt them) That though the Principle, in which ſuch of them, who have received from <hi>God</hi> a Divine and Spiritual Knowledge, have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is Unchangeable; yet the Enemy hath ſo prevailed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57559:213"/>as that the Seeds of Diſſention and Diſcord ſown amongſt them, have taken ſo deep Root, as that their Publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Worſhip, in ſeveral Parts of this Nation, have become the Stages of Contention, to the Diſhonour of <hi>God,</hi> his Truth and People. And in divers Parts of this Nation, 'tis reputed, that <hi>George Fox</hi> is (at leaſt) one of the Chief Abettors of one Party, and <hi>Iohn Story</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: But how far that Report may (with reſpect to <hi>G. F.</hi>) have Credit with others, beſides my ſelf, I ſhall leave to the Senſe and Savour of the underſtanding, impartial <hi>Reader,</hi> when he hath throughly peruſed this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though, from their Names mentioned in the <hi>Title-Page,</hi> ſome may be in Expectation, that the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the People called <hi>QUAKERS,</hi> with reſpect to the preſent Seperation, in ſome Parts of this Nation, may be Treated on at large; yet that's not my preſent Deſign, or Purpoſe: Though I muſt confeſs, that Matter is at large Collected, and impartially Stated, and lies ready by me for the Preſs; and in Probability, may come forth, or (at leaſt) a Part thereof, more than what is in this <hi>Fourth Part</hi> contained, in its proper Time and Seaſon; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall be pleaſed to change the Hearts of the Perſecuting Oppoſers of <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> and other Servants of the <hi>Lord,</hi> unto whom the Truth is as dear as ever; and that the Door may be opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in our Publick Aſſemblies, for Worſhip of <hi>God;</hi> whereby thoſe who have the Word of the <hi>Lord</hi> to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in the Demonſtration of his Power and Spirit, may not be ſo frequently obſtructed by the airy, imaginary, and empty Diſcourſes of ſuch, as have pretended to have the Word of the <hi>Lord</hi> to declare, when it hath evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, <hi>The Lord hath not ſpoken by them,</hi> if ſo be the <hi>Tree</hi> may at this Day be known by its Fruit, as well as in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57559:213"/>Dayes paſt: But rather, that the Words of the <hi>Prophet</hi> are fulfilling, if not fulfilled in them, when he ſaid; <hi>The Prophet is a Fool, the Spiritual Man is Mad, for the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thine Iniquity, and great Hatred,</hi> Hoſ. 9.7.</p>
                  <p>For I am a living Witneſs, that Imagination hath ſo poſſeſſed the Heads and Hearts of many, that Travel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>Miniſtring Friends,</hi> as that inſtead of manifeſting a Divine Underſtanding in the Things of <hi>God,</hi> or ſpeaking the Word of Truth in ſeaſon, they have brought forth the Fruits of an unſound Mind; ſhewing forth no better Reſemblance, or Evidence of being Miniſters of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (that divide the Word aright) than the Confuſed <hi>Chaos,</hi> before the Creation of <hi>God,</hi> was of the Beauty and Order that now is in it. And for my own part, I am well ſatisfied, (and that on ſufficient Ground, too large to inſert) that either the <hi>Multitude of Iniquity,</hi> or <hi>Great Hatred,</hi> through the Influence of <hi>G. F.</hi> poſſeſſing the Hearts of ſuch, is the Occaſion thereof.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding, my Deſign is not (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to Treat at large on the preſent Difference, between the People called <hi>QUAKERS,</hi> with reſpect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Seperation, in ſome Parts of this Nation; yet ſince I am alſo ſatisfied, (and that on ſufficient Ground) that <hi>G. F.</hi> hath been one of thoſe very Perſons, occaſioning the Differences to ariſe unto the Heighth they now are, or (at leaſt) a Countenancer thereof, at a large Rate; I purpoſe to Treat a little thereon, and partly as relating to <hi>G. F.</hi> that ſo the Impartial <hi>Reader</hi> may conſider, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if</hi> G. F. <hi>had contented himſelf (in Reality and Truth) with the Place of a Servant of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>that ſought not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over his Brethren's Faith, and Conſciences; nor yet to expect Submiſſion to his outward Precepts, Preſcriptions, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, further than every Friend to Truth was, or might be, by the Light of</hi> Chriſt <hi>in the Conſcience, led, and guided there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57559:214"/>The Differences now amongſt Friends, touching which ſome ſeem ready to bite and devour others, might never have been.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my own part, I in no wiſe queſtion, but that <hi>G. F. is one chief Inſtrument, that a deſtroying and devouring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath entred into ſome amongſt the Flock; and that many a Simple, Honeſt-hearted Friend to Truth and Righteouſneſs, have received and believed Lyes, and ſlanderous, falſe Reports againſt many Brethren undeſervedly; to the betraying of their Simplicity, and Love to the Truth, and filling their Hearts with Hatred, Enmity, and Prejudice, And of this am I as well ſatisfied, as I am that there is a</hi> God <hi>in Heaven, before whom both He, and all the Sons of Men, muſt come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that the Blood of many ſuch, if they periſh (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true Repentance) will be laid at</hi> G. F<hi>'s. Door: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I ſhould not have appeared to diſcover the ſaid</hi> G. F. <hi>as in Conſcience I am now conſtrain'd to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, a <hi>Warning</hi> is now proclaimed unto all ſuch, <hi>That they Redeem their Time, becauſe the Dayes are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> and proceed no further to receive and believe Lies, and Scandalous Reports againſt ſuch, (whom they have once accounted Honourable) on the Credit of <hi>G. F.</hi> as a Man that for ſeveral Years paſt, hath not Erred: For many are this day Witneſſes, that his Actions have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him an Erroneous Man. And for as much as he hath refuſed to give that Satisfaction for his Errours, as in the like Caſes he hath preſcribed for others, it hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd the Concern of my Conſcience to diſcover the ſame, and that alſo for the ſakes of the Simple, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-hearted; and that thoſe Innocent, and Tender Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that are growing up from the Loynes of Believing Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may, in their tender Years, be awakened and warned, that they may not be Captivated in the like Snare; and ſo bred up in a meer Form, and affected with Airy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57559:214"/>Imaginations, which have no Tendency to open their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; thereby to give unto them the Knowledge of thoſe Principles of Truth, which the Faithful, by the Spirit, have been led to own, and hold forth; nor yet the Way of the Kingdom of <hi>God,</hi> that ſo their Foot-ſteps may be directed into the Path of Peace, and they come to know a lively Feeling and Senſe of that Immortal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Spirit, by which the Everlaſting <hi>God,</hi> (whoſe VVayes are Unchangeable) reached unto many in the Beginning, when the very Thoughts of being <hi>Embondaged</hi> again with the <hi>Beggerly Elements</hi> and <hi>Rudiments</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> or of having our <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Dependency on any Mortal Man,</hi> was loathſome.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay; I had no Occaſion to Adviſe: But my Advice was, and is, <hi>That Condemnations ſhould not ſtand on our Deacons Books to Poſterity,</hi> according as the Meeting agreed unto; becauſe Failings in the Holy Scripture, have proved Weapons for the Man of Sin to fight with againſt Perfection: This is one Reaſon of many, that was given. Neither would I have them go further, than the Offence is known; nor continue longer, than the Memory of the Offence abideth; that we may walk in the Foot-ſteps of the holy Flock of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not <hi>Retain,</hi> when <hi>God Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth;</hi> but Meaſure, as we would be Meeted unto; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57559:215"/>Judge, as we would be Judged; conſidering our ſelves, leſt we alſo be Tempted.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 5. <hi>Whether thou oppoſed bringing in Friends Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Writing, concerning their Faithfulneſs, or Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the Caſe of Tythes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay; for I brought in One my ſelf, as a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt <hi>Tythes.</hi> I never gain-ſayed or hindred, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I force any one to write ſuch Teſtimonies.

                  <p>Qu. 6. <hi>Whether didſt thou approve, or conſent, or wer't preſent at the racing or tearing out of the Book</hi> H. G's <hi>Paper of Condemnation, for being Marryed by a Prieſt?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay; but Friends agreed, that Papers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations ſhould be taken out of the Book.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 7. <hi>Whether thou didſt not ſay, as touching Tythes, That thou wouldſt have all Friends left to their Freedom, to pay them, or not to pay them?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was never ſo ſaid by me, to the utmoſt of my Remembrance.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 2. <hi>Whether thou preached, or ſaid, That Tythes in themſelves was Not Unlawful?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I never ſo preach't and ſaid, to the utmoſt of my Remembrance, at any time, That Tythes, as they are now firſt paid and received by the Generality in <hi>England,</hi> were not Anti-chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 3. <hi>And, Whether didſt thou preach in the Meeting, when they of</hi> Preſton <hi>met with you, That</hi> Paul <hi>was let down in a Basket; and that when they Perſecuted you in one City, you ſhould Flee unto another; and that</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſometimes preach't upon the Mountains, and by the Sea-ſide; and the like?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not remember, that ever I preach't of <hi>Paul</hi>'s being let down in a Basket; nor yet of thoſe Scriptures, <hi>If they Perſecute you in one City, Flee unto another;</hi> but may do, when <hi>God</hi> puts them in my Mouth: But have uſed the Scriptures of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Preaching in Mountains, and by the Sea-ſide. If any have accuſed me for abuſing thoſe Scriptures, let them Exhibit their Accuſations, with their Names to it, and ſend it to me; and if I cannot defend my Innocency therein, they may have their deſired End.</p>

                  <p>Qu. 7. <hi>Whether their Houſes, which were offered to meet in, were not refuſed, when they met as afore-ſaid?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know no Houſe offered to Meet in, refuſed; and <hi>William Chambers</hi>'s Faithfulneſs, in offering his Houſe, was kindly Accepted by Friends; though we did not Meet there, being too far for the greateſt Part of the Meeting to go; and other Places much nearer, with which we were well ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 8. <hi>And, Whether didſt thou ſay, That to make a Diſtinct Aſſembly of Women, was a Monſter, and Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I never ſaid the Things that are Cited in this <hi>Query,</hi> neither as to the Matter nor End for which they are ſo peeviſhly ſtated: For I believe, if a Congregation of Women be together, they may Worſhip <hi>God,</hi> and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify one another, though there be no Man amongſt them. Yet I have ſaid to this purpoſe, That to ſet up a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57559:217"/>of Women by themſelves, (a Select Meeting ſeparate from the Men) once a Month, or Quarterly, only about the Practice of <hi>God</hi>'s Worſhip, and to give that Practice as the Reaſon, Cauſe, and End for which they ſeperate themſelves in ſo Meeting together, would ſeem to be <hi>Monſtrous</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous</hi> amongſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And as for Meeting of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by themſelves, about outward Buſineſs; when there is an Abſolute Occaſion for their ſo meeting about Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, moſt proper for them to inſpect into, I neither am, nor ever was againſt. But yet I would not have them carry it ſo high to us, as to threaten us with the Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying of <hi>Core,</hi> and ſuch horrid Offences, for ſimply asking, or diſcourſing about the Reaſon, or Neceſſity of their ſo Meeting.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 9. <hi>Whether didſt thou ſay at a Meeting, at</hi> William Chambers<hi>'s, when</hi> Margaret Fox <hi>was at Prayer, Friend, Keep Order?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I did not: Yet being grieved in Spirit, that I could not diſtinguiſh <hi>M. F's</hi> Words, when at Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Noiſe of Deceit, I ſpoke Three low Words to my ſelf only.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 10. <hi>And, Whether didſt thou ſay, That</hi> Margaret Fox <hi>had been a Hearer of Lies and Stories theſe Fifteen Years, and cared not what ſhe ſaid of any; but would not hear the Truth ſpoken from none?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the beſt of my Knowledge and Remembrance, ſuch things were never ſaid by me: Yet I am ſure, ſhe hath aſſerted many grievous Lyes under her Hand of me.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 11. <hi>Whether didſt thou ſay, That whoſoever did Sing or Sound, whilſt another was Preaching or Praying, it was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57559:217"/>and Diſorder, and a Spirit of Deluſion that led them to it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I never ſaid theſe Words, as ſet down in the <hi>Query;</hi> neither did I over deny any Singings, Soundings, Breathings, that had their Riſe from the Spirit of <hi>God:</hi> But all <hi>Images</hi> my Soul abhors.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 12. <hi>Whether didſt thou term or compare ſuch Singing or Sounding, to a Cat, or Catterwouling, or like unto an Horſe, or Belching of a Calf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I never did ſo compare it; but I gave a Relation of another that did.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 13. <hi>Whether didſt thou Read, or cauſe to be Read, or conſent to the Reading of, in the Latter-End of the Quarterly-Meeting, a Paper of</hi> Anthony Pearſons, <hi>that directed, That the Way of Truth ſhould be as the Way of a Ship in the Sea, and ſuch like?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I conſented to a Paper that had ſome ſuch Words; but knew not 'twas <hi>Althony Pearſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Qu. 14. <hi>Whether didſt thou adviſe, That Papers of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhould not be Recorded, or gain-ſayed it; and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Friends Teſtimonies concerning Friends Faithfulneſs, or Unfaithfulneſs, in the Caſe of Tythes?</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p>Qu. 16. <hi>And, Whether didst thou ſay, Thou wouldſt have all Friends left to their Freedom to pay Tythes, or not to pay Tythes?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this <hi>Sixteenth Query, John Story</hi> anſwered much to the ſame purpoſe as <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> did to the ſame <hi>Queſtion;</hi> which was the <hi>Seventh</hi> propoſed to <hi>John VVilkinſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though before the giving forth of theſe <hi>Queries,</hi> there might be ſome ſmall Differences amongſt Friends in the <hi>North,</hi> which were aggravated by <hi>G.

<note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>Note,</hi> John Story <hi>denyes, that he ever</hi> Judged the Power of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </note> Power of <hi>God,</hi> as it broke forth in Hymns, or Spiritual Songs: Yet many were not ſo well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, that <hi>G. F.</hi> was one of the chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that occaſioned, or at leaſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the keeping alive of thoſe Differences, until theſe <hi>Queries</hi> were ſent to <hi>John VVilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Story.</hi> But then Jealouſies entred many, that occaſion was ſought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and meerly becauſe they could not gratify that Spirit in <hi>G. F.</hi> which (as was alſo Jealouſed) had Accepted of ſuch Submiſſion from ſome, as many Faithful Friends have abhorred.</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>I now come to make ſome Obſervations on the afore-ſaid</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <hi>wherein I ſhall conſider the Matter of them, and the Manner of Negotiating that Matter.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>'Tis plain to me, that if <hi>John VVilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> had anſwered to each <hi>Query</hi> propoſed to them reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, <hi>[Yea;]</hi> then (ſince <hi>G. F.</hi> received the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57559:218"/>and proſecuted the ſame) the Informer againſt them to <hi>G. F.</hi> would have had his End; which doubtleſs was, To render them guilty of Evil Principles or Practices, and have <hi>G. F</hi>'s imaginary Authority to proſecute them for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The Conſideration whereof, leads me thus further to obſerve, That if any one of the Matters therein contained, could not render the Perſon therein concerned by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>[Yea]</hi> guilty of Unſoundneſs in Principle, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evil Practice; then 'twould follow, <hi>That</hi> G. F. <hi>(as well as the Informer) endeavoured to make the Perſon ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, an Offender in that Particular, which is no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> may now weigh the Matter in the Ballance of the Sanctuary; which, if he doth, he will doubtleſs perceive, that the Anſwer <hi>(Yea)</hi> to ſeveral of the <hi>Queries,</hi> will not render either of them, either Unſound in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or Blame-worthy, as to Matter of Fact.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Nineth Query</hi> to <hi>J. S.</hi> and his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 'tis obſervable, That if <hi>J. S.</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Keep Order,</hi> by way of Reproof to the Noiſe of <hi>Deceit,</hi> by one Perſon, (though pretending to ſing for Joy, whil'ſt another was Praying) 'tis no Matter of Evil Fact; but a Shame to any one ſo to Eſteem it, ſince <hi>God is a God of Order, and not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,</hi> in the Church.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, to me there is one thing above many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſeems worthy of Obſervation; and that is the <hi>Second Query</hi> to <hi>John VVilkinſon,</hi> when an Anſwer <hi>[Yea,]</hi> could not render him an Offender, unleſs 'tis ſound Doctrine, <hi>That the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ought to practiſe Things that are Impoſed by Man, or in the VVill of Man, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives no Authority or VVarrant for.</hi> If <hi>G. F.</hi> would be ſo plain, as poſitively to aſſert that, which ſeems to be implyed in that <hi>Query,</hi> (if from a <hi>Query</hi> any thing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57559:219"/>may properly be implyed) then 'twould put an End to the Controverſie with many: For then it muſt be aſſerted, <hi>That there is either One, or more, that have Power to Impoſe in the Will of Man, that which the Scripture gives no Authority, or Warrant for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding, I will ſuppoſe, in favour to <hi>G. F.</hi> that as Anſwer to this he may thus ſay, <hi>I did not put that Queſtion with an intent to juſtify <hi>Impoſition in the will of man;</hi> but rather to find out, whether what</hi> Robert Barrow, <hi>and others, have endeavoured to impoſe, (having a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that my Papers have been given forth in the Motion of God,) was accounted <hi>Things impoſed in the Will of Man;</hi> and that if it ſhould ſo appear,</hi> John Wilkinſon, <hi>unto whom the Queſtion was propoſed, might condemn the ſame; ſince I affirm, that I have given forth nothing to be impoſed, but what I have been <hi>Moved by the Spirit of God to give forth,</hi> and therefore ought to be <hi>ſubmitted to.</hi>
                     </hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this ſupoſition puts me in remembrance of an Objection raiſed in the ſeventh Section of the <hi>Firſt Part of the Manuſcript,</hi> wherein the Differences amongſt Friends are collected, as before is hinted; which with the Anſwer thereto, may be proper to Cite on this Occaſion. — The Objection and Anſwer followeth.</p>

                     <p>"Object. <hi>The Spirit of God, which is but One in All, hath moved in our Brethren to give forth certain <hi>Orders, Commands,</hi> and <hi>Preſcriptions,</hi> and therefore we ought accordingly to <hi>obey;</hi> and this cannot be called the <hi>Dictates of fallible Man;</hi> but of the Spirit, given forth through man: and waſt thou (that pretendeſt, <hi>Thou ſeeſt it not thy duty to obey</hi>) but obedient to thy ow mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, thou wouldſt then ſee it ſo, and be one with the Brethren, and therefore we cannot but tell thee, 'tis <hi>Thy Duty to obey,</hi> ſince the Reaſon thou ſeeſt it not

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57559:220"/>to wait upon God,</hi> becauſe 'tis manifeſt in every one, that hath been convinced of the Truth, that 'tis our Duty to wait upon <hi>God.</hi> And this our Senſe and Reaſon anſwers to the Teſtimony of the Scriptures of Truth; where 'tis ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all Ungodlineſs, and Unrighteouſneſs of Men, who hold the Truth in Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; becauſe that which may be known of God, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> So 'tis clear to us from the Scriptures of Truth <hi>without</hi> us, as well as from the Light of Chriſt <hi>within</hi> us, that the Wrath and Condemnation of <hi>God</hi> goes forth againſt ſuch, as live not anſwerable to what <hi>God</hi> hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in them: But 'tis neither agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth, or Light within, for any to pour forth their Judgments againſt any, for not following, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heed unto this, or t'other Outward <hi>Preſcription,</hi> or <hi>Obſervation;</hi> wherein the Conſcience is concerned, when ſuch are <hi>Not convinced thereof to be their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Mainfeſtation of God's Spirit in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing to be conſidered is this, That in all the laſt mentioned <hi>Objection,</hi> there is no Plea for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto, or following any thing, but the Spirit in its Appearance, whether through the Brethren, or thy ſelf.—From whence we obſerve:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no certain Deſcription, who are meant by the word <hi>Brethren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That 'tis the Appearance of the Spirit, that we ought to follow. Now, ſhould this Queſtion be asked of ſuch, who may ſo object, as afore-ſaid, <hi>Would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you have us follow we know not what?</hi> We are ready to believe, that they would ſay, <hi>Nay,</hi> if they anſwered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to the Queſtion: And if ſo, then the Force of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57559:220"/>the <hi>Objection</hi> falls; for that we account it our Duty to follow the Appearance of the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> through the meaneſt Member, when our Conſciences are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that 'tis the Appearance of that Spirit. But before we cannot ſay in Truth, though we ſhould do as ſuch an one would have us, That we are Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of, and led by the Spirit of God,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> 
                        <hi>No more than</hi> Jeſus <hi>can in Truth be called <hi>Lord,</hi> and not by the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, we cannot on this Occaſion but teſtifie, <hi>That as that Obedience which is of Faith in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>finds Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with the</hi> Lord; <hi>ſo that Obedience which is not of Faith, being Sin, is but a Dead Performance,
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> &amp; not the Fruit of a Living Member; who through the Obedience of Faith unto Righteouſneſs, is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live unto</hi> God. And therefore, it cannot be the Duty of any Member of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body, to run before his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Guide; but to wait upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> that all his Actions may be regulated according to the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Revelation of the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> in himſelf: Which ſeems clearly agreeable to the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith;
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.15, 16.</note> 
                        <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwiſe-minded,</hi> God <hi>ſhall reveal even this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: Nevertheleſs, whereunto we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that ſavours the Things of <hi>God,</hi> may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Meaning of the Spirit through <hi>Paul,</hi> unto thoſe <hi>Philippians,</hi> was, That thoſe who were come to a State of Perfection, ſhould walk by that Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they had attained; but thoſe who had not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far, and were otherwiſe-minded, were to wait for the Revelation of the Son.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>And now, to conclude as to this <hi>Objection;</hi> We have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57559:221"/>this further to add. That we do know, many of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, or at leaſt, ſuch who are not at Unity with us, have very confidently made uſe of ſuch Diſcourſe, as is contained in the laſt recited <hi>Objection,</hi> to induce us to follow <hi>Outward Preſcriptions,</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> though not convinced of its Service; which occaſions us to be jealous, <hi>That in Proceſs of Time, the Enemy may ſo enter in at this Door, as that Darkneſs may more generally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſhadow again, than it yet doth;</hi> though our Hope in <hi>God</hi> is, That he will lay ſuch a Conſtraint on many of thoſe, whoſe Eyes are open, beholding the <hi>Approached Apoſtacy,</hi> as that they may be raiſed in a Senſe of <hi>God</hi>'s Indignation, and appear as <hi>Lyons on the Behalf of the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah,</hi> to oppoſe every Appearance of that Spirit, which would be exalting <hi>Self,</hi> or any <hi>Outward Form, Obſervation, Preſcription,</hi> or <hi>Order,</hi> to be as a Bond on the Members of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body; when by the Light of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (their alone Law-giver) they are not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereof in their own Conſciences; which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly was the Meaning of the Spirit through <hi>Paul,</hi> when he writ unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 14.

                  </p>
                  <p>And to come a little cloſer to the Matter in hand, 'Tis too too evident, <hi>That Non-conformity to Outward Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, is taken as a Mark of Apoſtacy,</hi> even amongſt thoſe who have been under the Profeſſion of Truth; of which many Inſtances (too too large here to inſert) might be produced out of the Second Part of this

                  </p>
                  <p>Oh, Friends! The ſerious Conſideration of theſe things, bows us before the <hi>Lord;</hi> and in a Senſe of his Mercies to us, we can no longer keep Silence; but in his Fear, declare unto all, <hi>That our Conſciences are concerned for the Cauſe of God, and his Truth;</hi> And ſince it is ſo, that an ill Uſe is made of that Spirit of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and Condeſcenſion, which we are ſenſible hath been uſed by many of our Brethren, it is now become our Portion to unburthen our ſelves of that, which hath been our Burthen; believing; that the <hi>Lord</hi> is not only Ariſen, but will yet more and more Ariſe, <hi>Againſt that Spirit that would Exalt it ſelf over the Heritage of</hi> God; <hi>endeavouring to Rule over their Conſciences, whenas <hi>Chriſt alone</hi> is Lord thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be now worthy our Obſervation to conſider, whether any Encouragement was given by our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter, Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (whilſt on Earth) unto his Diſciples, to become Rulers one over another.</p>
                  <p>We find, that he Exhorts his Diſciples; <hi>Judge not, that ye be not Judged: Be not ye called</hi> Rabbi;
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.1 &amp; 23.8.</note> 
                     <hi>for one is your Maſter, even</hi> Chriſt; <hi>and all ye are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: But he that is Greateſt amongſt you; ſhall be your Servant; and whoſoever ſhall Exalt himſelf, ſhall be Abaſed; and he that ſhall Humble himſelf, ſhall be Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's no good ground to believe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> intended, that when he was departed, his Diſciples ſhould be Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves one over another, as Governours and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: And if we conſult the Scriptures of Truth, we ſhall find, that though his Diſciples had a Dependency upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57559:223"/>him, whilſt in his Bodily Appearance, to be their Leader; yet he tells them,
<note place="margin">John 16.7, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>It is expedient for you, that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you: But if I depart, I will ſend him unto you; And he will guide you into all Truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had it been ſo, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> intended the Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one of his Diſciples, as an Head or Supreme (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the reſt ought to have had an Eye, in a more particular Manner than ordinary) he would have undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſignified ſo much: But doubtleſs, he ſaw that their Eye and Dependency was too much on his Outward and Bodily Appearance; and therefore ſignified, <hi>'Tis expedient I go hence, that the Comforter come.</hi> Agreeable to which, are the Apoſtles Words; <hi>Though we have known</hi> Chriſt <hi>after the Fleſh, yet hence-forth know we <hi>Him</hi> no more;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>After the Fleſh no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which, doth clearly demonſtrate unto us, It's not according to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> that under this Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſhould have our Eyes out unto <hi>Man;</hi> but that our great Dependency ſhould be on that Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> teſtified, <hi>The Father would ſend in his Name, to teach us all Things; and that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter ſhould be <hi>In us.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, on this Occaſion 'tis with us to give this further Teſtimony, That every Member of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is through the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> made Dead unto any other Law, ſave the Law of the Spirit of Life, manifeſted through the Ariſing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his Appearance in every ſuch Member; and ſo as particular Members, are become Marryed unto him: And having all Fellowſhip each with other in the Spirit, thoſe who are ſuch, ought to demean themſelves each towards other, full of Love, Charity, Bowels of Compaſſion, Long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57559:223"/>Forbearance, Meekneſs, Humility, Patience, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and of all other Virtues, that are the Fruit of the Spirit of <hi>God:</hi> But as to <hi>Obedience,</hi> every Member owes that unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Head; unto whom,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Every Thought</hi> (according to the Teſtimony of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ought to be brought into Obedience.</hi> Thus far the Citation out of the afore-ſaid <hi>Manuſcript.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, to return again to the Conſideration of the Matter contained in the afore-ſaid <hi>Queries;</hi> 'Tis evident, that granting the <hi>Anſwers</hi> of <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to be true, it renders them Innocent Men, ſo far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Matters queried: And yet, 'tis too plain to me, that this gave not <hi>G. F.</hi> Satisfaction; (to which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpeak more particularly here after.) And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it could not be Juſt, according to his own Rule, (who hath often exhorted Friends, <hi>To follow Reports until the Author was found</hi>) to conceal the Informers, had the Anſwers of <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> given him ſatisfaction, then I query, <hi>Whether 't was not much more unjuſt to Conceal them, when the Anſwers gave not Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; eſpecially ſince</hi> John Wilkinſon <hi>teſtifieth, That he writ to thoſe who pretended</hi> G. F. <hi>deſired an Anſwer to the Queries, to deſire</hi> G. F. <hi>to give the Names of the Informers, with the witneſſes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That now which ſatisfies me, that the <hi>Anſwers</hi> gave not Satisfaction, is this; <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> and others concerned (at the Requeſt of <hi>G. F.</hi>) with <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> touching the ſaid <hi>Queries,</hi> were amongſt other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers to the <hi>Forty-Four Articles</hi> of Accuſation, drawn up againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> either jointly or ſeverally; wherein the Matters queried, were reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Articles</hi> of Accuſation: And not only ſo, but were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in writing a Letter unto others, touching this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57559:224"/>wherein they gave this Deſcription of <hi>Iohn Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Story,</hi> viz. <hi>And Friends, it is not any Perſonal Treſpaſs againſt any of us, that we charge them with, nor any Particular Concern of our own, as Men, that we are in the Defence of: But the Cauſe of Almighty</hi> God, <hi>and in the Senſe of the Wrong they have done to him.</hi> But yet, notwithſtanding, from the ſame Letter they ſay, <hi>They have born a Dear Love, and Honourable Reſpect unto them, in the Holy Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Comparing this with what is written in the <hi>Third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of the <hi>Forty-Four Articles</hi> before-cited, viz. <hi>Slighting the Heavenly Motion on</hi> G. F's <hi>Spirit, in that Caſe, in the Unity preciouſly felt, and cloſed with,</hi> (meaning the Rule or Form of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> ſet Forth by <hi>G. F.</hi> (as by the ſaid <hi>Article</hi> appears) 'tis to me evident, that in the Senſe of all, who are Eſpouſers of thoſe <hi>Articles,</hi> a <hi>Slighting of</hi> G. F's <hi>Outward Rules, Methods and Orders, with Reſpect to</hi> Church-Government, <hi>amongſt the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>is a Slighting of the Cauſe of</hi> God.</p>
                  <p>I now appeal to all ſuch, as are not ignorant of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that is given by <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> &amp;c. unto <hi>G. F.</hi> whether 'tis Rational to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> &amp;c. would have concerned themſelves in Subſcribing and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betting ſuch <hi>Articles,</hi> as related to the ſaid <hi>Queries,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Approbation or Permiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I well remember, that in a <hi>Reply</hi> made by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barrow,</hi> and others, to <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> their Anſwer to the <hi>Forty-Four Articles</hi> afore-ſaid, <hi>John Story</hi> is accounted a <hi>Man of a Dark Spirit, and in Confuſion,</hi> becauſe he did not believe, <hi>That what was given forth by</hi> G.

                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">"What do you think to do with your vainly Attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſet <hi>One</hi> of <hi>Vs</hi> againſt <hi>Another,</hi> if you could, through your hatching and ſucking up ſuch Lies as theſe?

                  </p>
                  <p>My <hi>Obſervations</hi> hereon are theſe; What <hi>John Blaikling</hi> accounts a Lye, is only a <hi>Query</hi> relating to <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>John Blaikling;</hi> and which <hi>John Blaikling</hi> gave me occaſion to Query, (as in the latter Part of <hi>The Fifth Part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-Quaker</hi> will appear:) By which it evidently appears, that in <hi>John Blaikling</hi>'s Senſe, <hi>G. F.</hi> was one of thoſe <hi>[Vs,]</hi> unto whom <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi>'s Prophecy extended; which was on the Occaſion of the afore-ſaid <hi>Queries,</hi> and related to the Perſons concerned therein.</p>
                  <p>Now, foraſmuch as <hi>G. F.</hi> ſpreads abroad the <hi>Poſt-ſcript,</hi> wherein 'tis written, as afore-ſaid; it naturally follows, that he owns himſelf to be one of thoſe <hi>[Vs]</hi> mentioned by <hi>John Blaikling;</hi> and they were the Perſons concerned in the <hi>Queries,</hi> as afore-ſaid.</p>
                  <p>I now come to ſignifie, that after the afore-ſaid <hi>Forty-Four Articles</hi> of Accuſation were drawn up, <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> &amp;c. (all Informers againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi>) writ to <hi>Nine</hi> other Perſons, whom the ſaid Informers (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Aſſent of <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi>) choſe as Judges, to Judge the Caſe, thereby (as I ſuppoſe) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the Slander of being Accuſers and Judges: But
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57559:226"/>
                     <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> would not own their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſo refuſed to appear before them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they proceeded to Judge the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Things contained in the <hi>Forty-Four Articles,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exceptions; which manifeſted their Weakneſs, as not capable to diſcern between Good and Evil, <hi>Since many of the Articles were Uncondemnable.</hi> But foraſmuch as it is not my preſent Purpoſe to cite the Particular Letters, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and Judgment on this Occaſion, I willingly at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent omit the ſame, with this only <hi>Obſervation,</hi> That I am well ſatisfied, (from the Obſervations and Matters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned) that <hi>G. F.</hi> was privy to theſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and if he eſteem Himſelf one having the Care of the Churches upon him, (as no doubt, he doth) he would in probability have been a Reproof thereto, had he thought the Proceedings Reproveable.</p>
                  <p>This Judgment became a Concern on many <hi>Friends</hi> in the Nation; ſo that ſeveral from <hi>London</hi> writ to <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Bristol,</hi> to go down into the <hi>North,</hi> to endeavour an <hi>Accomodation of the Differences;</hi> for that divers Papers by this time, both on the one Hand, and on the other, were ſpread up and down the Nation; and Perſons concerned came to be variouſly affected: Such as believed <hi>G. F.</hi> to be what I know he hath deſcribed himſelf, and that in my own hearing, <hi>viz. <hi>One unto whom Infallible Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been Committed in all Things; and that he knew a State of Purity at Eleven Years of Age;</hi>
                     </hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſufficient Satisfaction, that <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> and all at Unity with them, were Apoſtatized, when they underſtood <hi>G. F.</hi> owned them not.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Door became ſhut unto theſe, whereby their Conſciences might be ſatisfied of the Goodneſs or Badneſs of the Tree from the Taſte of the Fruit, as if this were Sound and Rational Diſcourſe: <hi>Alas! I have an Inward
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57559:226"/>Savour, that the Fruit of the Tree is bad; though I confeſs, I have been ſo far from taſting of the Fruit, as that I have never ſeen the Tree, nor yet what kind of Fruit it bears, more than by Report.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here methinks this Obſervation and Objection may be urged as rational.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>Thy whole Diſcourſe ſeems to carry a kind of an Edge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit that of late years hath acted through</hi> G. F. <hi>of whom 'tis certainly known from his Writings (yet extant) That he hath thus adviſed, <hi>Take heed of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, and Iudge not one another, I command you, in the Preſence of the Lord; neither lay open one anothers Weakneſs, behind one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Backs: For thou that doſt ſo, art one of</hi>
                     </hi> Ham's <hi>Family, which is under the Curſe; and that there be no Back-biting behind one anothers Backs, but Love. And ſo the ſame that doth Condemn behind the Back, is for Condemnation with the Light.</hi> It al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo can be proved, That his Counſel hath been, <hi>To follow an Evil Report, until the Original Reporter be found:</hi> And his End, I believe, then was, <hi>That Judgment might be laid on the Head of the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which being ſeriouſly conſidered, the <hi>Objector</hi> may then ſay:</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>How comes it to paſs, that many of his Actions come under the juſt Stroke and Cenſure of his own Words?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I ſay, I know not how better to Anſwer, than to teſtify, <hi>That Pride muſt have a Fall,</hi> and that my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57559:227"/>is, the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſuffered this great Evil to come upon him, and to be thus manifeſted unto thoſe, who have profeſſed his Name, that they may have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency on any <hi>other Name,</hi> that may be given under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but the <hi>Name of Jeſus,</hi> the Eternal Son of the living <hi>God;</hi> and that every one that hath made a Profeſſion, that the Appearance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his Light in Man, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to guide ſuch as obey the ſame unto the Father of Life, ſo they may not be led by the ſubtil Crafts and Inventions of Men, to leave that Teacher, and have their dependence on the Lines of others made ready to their Hands, though under the very Pretence of being the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Light it ſelf. For under that Pretence, <hi>Satan</hi> in many Ages paſt, hath ſhrowded himſelf, as an Angel of Light; on which Subject, a large Volumn might be Written, moſt evidently to illuſtrate the ſame, which I omit now, being not my preſent Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>This my Senſe and Anſwer on the laſt Obſervation and Objection, I am now ſenſible, may create in ſome this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>What cunning Devices have been uſed amongſt the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>whereby the Weak, and moſt Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Sort amongſt them, have been ſo enſnared, as to Judge from a pretended inward Senſe, that the Tree is bad, when the Perſon ſo Judging, hath neither ſeen the Tree nor Fruit, nor yet knows any thing thereof, more than by Report.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I Anſwer, That ſome amongſt them, (known to ſtand by <hi>G. F.</hi> even in the vindication of many Errors, whereof <hi>G. F.</hi> is Guilty, to the diſſatisfaction of a very great Number amongſt the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) have publiſht with <hi>Seeming Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Thundering Lungs,</hi> ſuch
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57559:227"/>like kind of Doctrine, and Exhortation as this: <hi>Away with this Iealous Spirit: Oh Friends! exclude the Reaſon, the Wiſdom, and the Iealouſy, and have an Eye to the Brethren: If you do not ſee your ſelves, then follow us that do ſee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And no doubt, but this Doctrine hath been ſuckt in by many; and then 'tis eaſie to be favour'd, that if the Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof do but once put the <hi>Bare-Skin</hi> on any <hi>Friends Back,</hi> (though never ſo much of the <hi>Lamb's Nature</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>) there will not be wanting thoſe Sorts of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> with whom ('tis ſuppoſed) <hi>Paul</hi> fought at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> (who undoubtedly were Unreaſonable Men) to bait that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, on whom (to ſpeak comparatively) the <hi>Bear-Skin</hi> is put.</p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe may occaſion this further Inquiry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By what Mark may we beſt be Informed to diſcover thoſe Miniſtring Perſons, in your Publick Meetings, who are of Party with</hi> G. F. (as thou takeſt it) <hi>and that are the Encouragers of ſuch Doctrine, and Exhortation,</hi> (as before-mentioned) <hi>to exclude the Reaſon, the Wiſdom, and the Jealouſie; and to have an Eye to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> &amp;c? (By which word <hi>[Brethren]</hi> I know is meant one Party of thoſe called <hi>Miniſtring Friends.</hi>) <hi>This I query of thee the rather, becauſe thou accounteſt it a Good Rule, to Judge of the Tree by thy own Taſte and Savour of the Fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> What Garb they may appear in, I know not; But the Garb they have appeared in, and the Fruits they have brought forth, I well know, by the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of my Ear,</hi> which are theſe: They have been much Exerciſed in crying out againſt <hi>Dark Spirits, Leavened Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Troublers of Iſrael,</hi> (thereby intending ſuch as have,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57559:228"/>and yet do approve themſelves Faithful Friends) gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Teſtimony of ſuch, as have declared the Word of <hi>God,</hi> in our Publick Meetings, in the Demonſtration of the Power and Spirit; though they have not been capable to detect the Publiſher with any <hi>Evil Conſerſation,</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs of Doctrine;</hi> and oft-times ſpend their Breath at an eager Rate, a long time together: when ſome part (at leaſt) of what they bring forth, (being but duly weighed) is a meer Scandal to Religion, the Principle and Practice of our Antient Friends, in the Beginning: Not having a Word (in many ſuch tedious Diſcourſes I him at) to inform the Congregation of the Principles of Truth, which the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have profeſt; nor yet to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Hearers in the Way that leads unto Life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>This</hi> (may ſome ſay) <hi>is treating of Things in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Way, without particular Matter, to evidence this general Reflection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs, 'tis ſo; and that it ought not to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence againſt any one not named; neither is it my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that it ſhould: But rather, that I may thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Remembrancer to thoſe, who may read the ſame, that they may conſider, whether it hath not been ſo, though at ſuch times they may have been ſo much ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up with Affection to an imaginary, airy Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſounded forth with the Outward Appearance of great Zeal, as that they have taken that to be <hi>pure Good Bread,</hi> which in Reality is nothing but <hi>Empty Husks.</hi> And if any ſhall think my general Reflection wholly groundleſs, let ſuch give the Notice thereof, and I doubt not, but I ſhall be capable to bring many ſufficient Witneſſes to the Truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: For at the Moment I now write, I am well ſatisfied,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57559:228"/>there are <hi>Hundreds</hi> will teſtify the ſame, who have been <hi>Ear-Witneſſes,</hi> as well as my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>However, I muſt alſo teſtify, That there are others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> (and that I hope, by far the greater Part) that cannot be affected with ſuch kind of Doctrine and Exhortation, as to <hi>Exclude the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the VViſdom, and the Jealouſie; and</hi> (whether they ſee, or ſee not) <hi>to have their Eyes unto others, ſo as to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them:</hi> And theſe are not willing to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either the one way, or the other, in relation to the Differences, further than from certain Evidence of Matter of Fact. And theſe, not receiving ſufficient Satisfaction, that <hi>John VVilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> were ſuch as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, have been (as I am fully perſwaded) termed ſuch as had let in <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>VViſdom;</hi> and on that foot, termed <hi>Dark Spirits,</hi> by the Publiſhers or Approvers of this Doctrine, <hi>Have an Eye to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and if you do not ſee your ſelves, you muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us that do ſee.</hi> A notable Expedient, whereby the <hi>Leader,</hi> and thoſe who may be <hi>Led,</hi> may (like Blind-Men) fall into the <hi>Ditch</hi> together; and inſtead of following the Bright Beams of the <hi>Sun,</hi> may be found Followers only of the dark Body of the—<hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be ſhort; When I conſider whence they came, and how Great <hi>G.

                     <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> and Three more, (all Informers againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi>) writ to ſome Friends of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> on the Occaſion of their Diſlike of ſome Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the <hi>North,</hi> and acquaint them, <hi>That by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of</hi> God's <hi>Power, they have an Underſtanding given them of</hi> God, <hi>to Act and Determine in Affairs appertaining to the Goſpel, and its Order.</hi> And foraſmuch as this hath been ſignifyed unto <hi>G.

                                 <hi>ON the whole Matter, in the Fear and Preſence of the Amighty</hi> God, <hi>we declare, That as we do approve of</hi> Monthly <hi>and</hi> Quarter-Meetings, <hi>for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſary Service of the Truth; ſo we further ſay, That as theſe, or any other Meetings of Friends in Tenth, ſhall be continued to anſwer theſe Services, we believe, that as it now is, it alſo will become our Duty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57559:230"/>to be at Vnity with our Brethren in the Services there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And though one of us,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> John Wilkinſon) <hi>did condeſcend to ſubſcribe to a Paper, for the Execting a</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans-Meeting <hi>in the Country, to anſwer the Ends in the Paper propoſed; which (he teſtifies) he then did in Singleneſs of Heart, for Vnity's ſake: Yet according to that inward Senſe we now have, there appears to us no Abſolute Neceſſity to continue</hi> Womens-Meetings <hi>in this Country, diſtinct and ſeparate from the</hi> Men; <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, do Conſcientiouſly forbear to Aſſent or Encourage to lay the</hi> Intentions of Marriages <hi>before them. Yet that Inward Senſe, and Heavenly Vnderſtanding we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from</hi> God, <hi>hath and yet doth confirm us in this Iudgment; That 'tis not agreeable with the Line of Truth, to oppoſe others in the Exerciſe, and appointed Service of the ſaid Meetings, as here-to-fore, and yet ſettled and agreed upon; who being Conſcientious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, are otherwiſe minded than we are. And if any of our Words and Actions have had any Tendency to oppoſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(which we are not Conſcious of; but if we were, we would readily confeſs) we ſay, the Truth in us would have Condemned it, even as it now doth.

                                 <hi>That though many of our Brethren ſee a Service in</hi> Recording Condemnations, <hi>and</hi> Leaving them upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to Poſterity; <hi>yet from that Inward Senſe, and Heavenly Vnderſtanding we have, we ſee no Neceſſity to leave them upon</hi> Record to Poſterity, <hi>or retain them, when the Sin is blotted out, and remitted by the</hi> Lord; <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be extended further than the Offence is known; nor yet to continue longer, than the Memory of the Offence abideth. But if any ſee meet from an Inward Senſe of Truth in themſelves, to leave ſuch Teſtimonies rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to themſelves to Poſterity, we have there-with V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. That this our Senſe may be no Occaſion of Strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit each towards others, is the Earneſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our Souls; who deſire the Proſperity of Truth, and Peace amongſt all the Churches of</hi> God.</p>

And that as the</hi> Firſt <hi>is</hi> Diſcouraged, <hi>the</hi> Second <hi>ought to be</hi> Encouraged. <hi>And the Earneſt Deſires of our Souls are, That as to theſe Things, nothing but the Spirit of Truth, and ſound Iudgment may appear, either to Reprove, or to Encourage.

                                 <hi>As to the</hi> Two Queſtions <hi>Anſwered by the Friends and Brethren met on this Occaſion; We, in the Fear of the</hi> Lord <hi>ſay, We in the Propoſing thereof, had not the leaſt Thoughts to obtain your</hi> Yea <hi>and</hi> Nay, <hi>with intent thereby to ſtrengthen ſuch who may be accounted our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in any thing that's contrary to Truth; nor to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Looſneſs, or Bad Spirits: But conſcientiouſly to remove the Scruples of ſome. And further, we ſay, We are better ſatisfyed with your</hi> Explication <hi>therein, than with your bare</hi> Yea <hi>and</hi> Nay: <hi>For that we as well as you are ſenſible, Apoſtates, and Bad Spirits, ſeeking a Fleſhly Liberty, have made uſe of Arguments deducible from ſuch Principles of Truth, to oppoſe the Power of</hi> God <hi>it ſelf, and the Practice of</hi> God's <hi>People in the Power.</hi>

                        <p>I <hi>Received thy Lines, in which thou ſay'ſt,</hi> This is the Word of the <hi>Lord</hi> to you, <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> and your <hi>Company,</hi> to call in all your Papers, which you have given forth in your Separation, <hi>
                              <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I judge, thou meaneſt not, that that is a Separation, that all Friends meet not Outwardly together. Truly,</hi> George, <hi>we might have expected, thou would have told us in Love, what the Separation thou ſpeakeſt of conſiſted in; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are ſeparated from the Light within, the Doctrine of Truth; or have builded again that which we have once deſtroyed; or what we have left undone, that</hi> God's <hi>Truth in our Hearts requires of us; and what Papers we have given forth againſt the Light Within? When the Word through thee, concerning this Matter, enters our Hearts, and gives Light to us, that the Light of Truth manifeſts us guilty of a</hi> Separation from God's Truth, <hi>and</hi> Giving out Papers againſt it; <hi>we ſhall readily confeſs it, and Repent. But till we know it, the Word of the</hi> Lord, <hi>that is as a Hammer, and thy Propheſies be to them, who are in the Separation, and in Strife,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57559:232"/>cauſing Diviſions,</hi> viz. <hi>with</hi> Articles of Accuſations, <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting Friends Minds with a New Form, and Way of Proceeding, carryed on with a Profeſſion of</hi> Church-Authority, <hi>and great Help; which indeed, was ſeldom wanted in a Separation from Truth, when the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy entred. And truly, there is great Cauſe of Iealouſie, what will be the End of theſe Things. Thou ſhouldſt have told us, what new Things we have brought in, as bad as the old Oppoſers,</hi> James Naylor, <hi>and his</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>and</hi> John Perrot, <hi>and</hi> Pennyman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before thou hadſt told us, <hi>The</hi> Lord God would blaſt your Spirit and Work. <hi>And if</hi> James Naylor's <hi>Oppoſition conſiſted in</hi> Not Reproving his Company, <hi>when they bowed to him, and cryed</hi> Hoſanna, <hi>let it be a Warning to thee, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thy Company when they give thee the</hi> Titles and Honour due to the Higheſt; <hi>leſt they that love Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and Rule, out-live thy Time, and render thy Weakneſs to others, as thou haſt done his, when thou art Dead, and in thy Grave, turned to Duſt. Therefore, be Humble, as a Member of the Heavenly Body, under</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Head, who Ruleth in his Church and People, whoſe Right it is. And remember the word to</hi> Moſes, <hi>with the time and place of his Death, who ſanctified not God in the ſight of</hi> Iſrael <hi>his people. Oh! well may Friends be called</hi> Apoſtates <hi>in their Day, and be Curſt of Men when they are Dead, whoſe Condemnations are left on Record by others to Poſterity, in the Churches Books; ſeeing</hi> James Naylor <hi>by thee is called an</hi> Old Oppoſer, <hi>who confeſt his Weakneſs, Repented and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Truth, and Peace with God: But,</hi> George, <hi>we might have been perſwaded that thy Counſel, and Advice thou gaveſt to the Churches in writing, is greatly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and we cannot Judge, how thou couldſt intend</hi> Force, <hi>or ſuch a way of proceeding with Friends about them.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57559:233"/>That which I ſee at preſent tending to Vnity is, for thee to Manifeſt, what thou intendedſt by them if thou intendeſt no force with them (which thou couldſt not do in Truth; for that would let thee ſee Diviſions would be the effect of them) then manifeſt the Abuſe they have done to thee, and thy Counſel to Friends, by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings about them, that we may know that thou art the ſame in Principle, in Doctrine, and Practice, as in the beginning (when thy Teſtimony was recommended to the Witneſs of God in all Conſciences) that thou mayſt clear thy ſelf, that thou approveſt of no</hi> Force <hi>about</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>but the Force and Effect of the Word delivered; that the encreaſe may be of God, and we all, unto whom Gods Love hath been large, may have Vnity in Truth, as in the Beginning.</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57559:234"/>would have been in Unity with me, as at the firſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And thou hadſt better have taken the Word of the</hi> Lord <hi>patiently, and not reſiſted it: But it ſeems, it has been as a Fire unto Thee, and You. For it was ſent in Tenderneſs and Care unto you, and for your Good; though thou wouldſt make thy ſelf ignorant of what Separation you were gone into: For you are ſeparated from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Light and Spirit; that you went from before you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Outwardly. And this Spirit was afraid of being limited; but it would limit the Univerſal Spirit, both in Males and Females, as your Fruit has manifeſted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Practice of</hi> Womens-Meetings, <hi>and</hi> Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condemnations, <hi>and</hi> Admoniſhing Payers of Tythes, <hi>and other Evils, as your Books, and Papers, and Neighbours can teſtify. But thou who haſt ſaid,</hi> They muſt be left to themſelves, to Condemn this Year, or the other, <hi>&amp;c. this gives Liberty to the Fleſh: For whil'ſt it is to Day, they muſt hear his Voice.</hi>

                           <hi>But,</hi> John, <hi>I ſavour thy Spirit, and know that thy Words come from an Angry, Diſquieted, Fretful, Peeviſh Spirit. And poor Men and People! for my part, I pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you, as knowing and ſeeing, that you are out of the Life, and are not in the Spirit that did firſt Convince you, and ſo not in the Firſt Love: And if ever thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the tender Spirit, and Light of</hi> Chriſt <hi>in thy Heart, thou wilt ſee all thoſe your Books and Papers of Strife, and your Separation is all for Condemnation with the Light
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57559:234"/>of</hi> Chriſt; <hi>and they are the Works of that Spirit that led thee into Death, and Strife. And now thou cryeſt,</hi> What? <hi>and</hi> Wherein? <hi>and</hi> This, <hi>and the</hi> Other: <hi>But come in, and look into thy ſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And I ſay again, It is the ſame Spirit that led</hi> James Naylor, <hi>and</hi> John Perrot, <hi>and others; and</hi> John Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot <hi>cryed againſt</hi> Impoſition, <hi>as you do; and againſt the</hi> Mens-Meetings, <hi>as you do againſt the</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Though I know,</hi> James Naylor <hi>did for himſelf Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that Spirit, that led into a Separation; which had been well, if you had done ſo too: And his</hi> Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>is Recorded, as well as his</hi> Condemnation. <hi>But many of his People remain to this Day out, and have been, and are as much againſt</hi> Men <hi>and</hi> Womens-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>as you: And ſo it is but the ſame Spirit ſtill.</hi>

                           <hi>And</hi> James Naylor's <hi>Oppoſition did not conſiſt only in</hi> Not Reproving his Company, for the Titles they gave him; <hi>but his Oppoſition ſtood ſeveral Years, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other Matters; and his People cryed againſt our Meetings, and ſought with all their Might to deſtroy them: But the</hi> Lord's <hi>Power blaſted them all, that did not come in by Repentance and Judgment.</hi>

                        <p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Poor Man! Is here thy Envy broken out? But, What are the Titles? and, Who are them that have given them? And, When? and, Where?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And whereas thou ſayeſt;</hi> Leſt they that love Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence and Rule, out-live my Time, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my VVeakneſs to others.</p>
                        <p>John, <hi>Who are thoſe that love</hi> Preheminence? <hi>And, What is my</hi> VVeakneſs, <hi>that they may render it? Why didſt thee not mention it in thy Paper?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But this is from a prejudiced, malicious Spirit, and not from the Light of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>to render my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>when I am Dead, and in my Grave turned to Duſt. Nay,</hi> John, <hi>that which thee ſtrikes at, and thy Company, and all the Evil Spirits in the World have ſtruck at, and all the Apoſtates before thee, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver turn it to Duſt; neither ſhall you ever get it into the Duſt; Glory to the Everlaſting</hi> God <hi>for ever. For,</hi> He that Over-comes, ſhall go no more forth, and ſhall never Periſh; and he that Believeth on the Son of <hi>God,</hi> hath Everlaſting Life.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But if this be the Way of thy Preaching, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Heavenly Body turn to Duſt, I fear thou haſt begotten none to</hi> God; <hi>but into a Profeſſion, that will turn to Duſt, like thy ſelf; and Duſt is the Meat of this Spirit; that I know.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For I am in a Life that is over that Spirit, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thee, nor the World cannot touch: And if thou comes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57559:235"/>to be as</hi> Judas, <hi>and Betray the Truth to the</hi> Prieſts; <hi>I know what thee, and they can kill, if</hi> God <hi>will ſuffer you: But I do not fear it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And I muſt tell thee, it is the Spirit of</hi> Judas, <hi>the Betrayer, that is gone from Truth; and now would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray others from the Heavenly Body, in the Eternal Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, in the Eternal Head: For,</hi> That which is Earthly, is Earthly; and that which is Heavenly, is Heavenly.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And thou bidſt me,</hi> Be Humble, as a Member of the Heavenly Body, under <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Head, <hi>&amp;c. So, thou tell'ſt me,</hi> I am a Member of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Heavenly Body; <hi>yet thou ſayest,</hi> When I am turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Duſt, and Dead: <hi>Is this thy Doctrine? Are the Members of the Heavenly Body turned to Dust, and Dead? This Doctrine ſurely proceeds from Darkneſs, and not from the Light of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And, Is it to this thou wouldst have me bow, and be humbled to? Nay,</hi> John, <hi>I need none of thy Miniſtry; and it will do no good, in the State thou ſtands in, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: For it is an Angry, Malicious, Froward Spirit, that has poſſest thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And further, thou bid'ſt me,</hi> Remember the Word to <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the Time and Place of his Death, who Sanctified not <hi>God</hi> in the Sight of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his People. <hi>What dost thou infer from thence,</hi> John, <hi>That I have not Sanctified</hi> God <hi>before his People? So, thou
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57559:236"/>haſt ſet me above a Common Member, and put me into an Office then; but, Muſt that which Sanctifies</hi> God, <hi>be turned to Duſt?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I thought,</hi> John, <hi>thou hadſt owned</hi> Chriſt <hi>to be the Sanctifyer of all, who is Greater than</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the End of</hi> Moſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But,</hi> John, <hi>Wherein have not I Sanctified the</hi> Lord? <hi>What Liberty have I given to Sin; or any that are Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that have not followed you in your Separation? Have you not taken Offence against ſome of them, that came to Admoniſh ſuch as were not Faithful amongst you, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it</hi> Over-driving them; <hi>yea, ſuch as have been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Spirit of</hi> God? <hi>And, Was it not called</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, <hi>when ſome went to Admoniſh</hi> Preſton-<hi>Meeting, when they did not ſtand ſtedfast to the</hi> Lord? <hi>And, How was the</hi> Lord <hi>ſanctifyed amongst you then? And, How was the</hi> Lord <hi>ſanctifyed amongſt you, concerning your Paying of</hi> Tythes, <hi>or your Conniving at your Wives or others Paying for you? Much of which I could write concerning ſuch like Things, but I ſhall forbear. But when you were in Strife, I would have had you come over to me, that you might have been brought into Unity before your Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but you refuſed.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Which had you loved the Goſpel of Peace, you would have come to me, before you had made ſuch a Jumble with your ſtrife up and down the Nation: For I have heard by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Faithful Friends, where you have ſent your Papers to prejudiced Perſons against</hi> Men <hi>and</hi> Womens-Meetings, <hi>and</hi> Recording Commendations, <hi>and other</hi> Friends <hi>Practices; which has begotten a great Diſlike in</hi> Friends <hi>concerning you: For what hath this been, but to ſtir up Strife, and to ſow Diſcord?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But, Are not</hi> David, <hi>and</hi> Manaſſes, <hi>and</hi> Peter, <hi>and many others their Sins recorded, and their Repentances, and Changing recorded in the Holy Scriptures? And, What needs</hi> John VVilkinſon <hi>be afraid, and trouble himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Recording the Condemnation of Sin, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Just?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But, Who has curſed</hi> David <hi>or</hi> Peter, <hi>or any other, (whoſe Condemnation of Sin and Repentance, and turning from it, is Recorded) or called them</hi> Apoſtates?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And, What Spirit is this in</hi> John Wilkinſon, <hi>that would not have ſuch Things recorded now, which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth recorded in former Ages?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Surely, it is not the Spirit of</hi> God, <hi>nor Light of</hi> Chriſt: <hi>For if they be Sins private, that only the Church knows them, then they go no further than the Church: But if they be open Sins, to the World amongst Sinners, then their Condemnation and Repentance must go as far as the Fact is known.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But if</hi> John VVilkinſon <hi>be afraid, lest he ſhould be Curst, and his Company, and counted</hi> Apoſtates <hi>to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, if their Failings, Sins, and Tranſgreſſions ſhould be Recorded: Truly, without your Repentance, they will be Recorded; and it would be well, if you did Repent and Condemn them; for then your Reſurrection would be Recorded out of this Apostacy: Elſe you need not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion standing upon Record. And they that have been led by you into a Separation, and now come off from you, do not bleſs you, as ſeveral have declared: So you bring that upon your ſelves, which you think to avoid.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But, Why ſhouldst</hi> Thou <hi>and</hi> You <hi>be ſo afraid of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your Repentance from Sin, and Evil Actions record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which you have committed in grieving</hi> God's <hi>Spirit, and his People; and opening the Mouthes of the World, without a Fear of being Curst, or counted Apostates? Is this the Cauſe you would hide your Sins, and have no Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony given forth against you? If</hi> Thou <hi>and</hi> You <hi>have ſuch a Love to them,</hi> Thou <hi>and</hi> You <hi>may keep them; but the Truths Testimony will stand against all that is out of the Truth. And there are</hi> Condemnations <hi>upon Record ever ſince</hi> 1652. <hi>ſo no new thing amongst us, but according to the Light of</hi> Chriſt. <hi>But the</hi> Lord <hi>knows, I would have nothing but what is Pure to Rule and Reign, and all Sin and Evil to be Condemned; and that which is Private to be only amongst</hi> Friends; <hi>and that which is Publick, to be publickly Condemned to the

And if the World ſhould ſay,</hi> Such a one did ſo or ſo; <hi>there is a</hi> Teſtimony <hi>upon Record, that ſuch an one was Converted and Tranſlated, to Poſterity, as</hi> David <hi>was from the Evil to Good, and from the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Light: And had you continued in the Light of</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>and in his Spirit that led the Saints to condemn thoſe Evils, which are Recorded in Scripture, and to Glorify</hi> God <hi>in their Reſurrection, you would never have been in Oppoſition againſt the Church of</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice now; in ſuch things, by the ſame Spirit, you call it a New Way. And that which would not have Sin and Evil condemned, and condemns that which Records it, is for Condemnation: For, inſtead of being Curst (as thou ſayeſt) them that do condemn Sin and Evil, and ariſe out of that which is condennied, and this being Recorded to Poſterity, the Church, and their Relations can teſtify to their Change, and their Dying in the</hi> Lord.</p>
                        <p>

And ſo you have loſt that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that was in the Beginning, and your Nakedneſs is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; that the</hi> Prieſts, Juſtices, <hi>and</hi> Drunkards <hi>can

                        <p>
                           <hi>And look into your ſelves, if there be not a Froward, Stubborn, Self-willed Spirit, and Rough, and Short, that now may talk of the Light of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and would have Liberty; but is to be Reproved; and well it would be for you, if you would turn at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi>

If thou waſt in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Spirit, and Power of God, that is over All, thou wouldſt not make ſuch a Noiſe about</hi> Impoſition: <hi>For indeed, it is the very</hi> Spirit of Impoſition <hi>in Thee and You, that does not know what it would be at it ſelf, nor to what to bring others. And much I could ſay, as to that: But that whereby you may come into</hi> Unity, <hi>it muſt be in the Unlimited Power, and Spirit, and Light, that did first Convince you, and brought you into</hi> Unity, <hi>and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Preſcription of your</hi> Elders, <hi>or</hi> Deacons, <hi>or your</hi> Members. <hi>So, your Way to come into</hi> Unity <hi>is, to come to the Light and Spirit, that did first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, and Judge and Condemn this Spirit, that hath led you into Separation, with all its Works ſince: And then, in that Spirit, there is no Fear of Impoſition, but Everlaſting Unity, in the Everlasting Seed, that bruiſes the Head of the Serpent, and all his Sons of</hi> Belial, <hi>that are without the Yoak, and are afraid of it. Now,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57559:238"/>there are them that would not be Yoaked with the Law of God, nor with the Goſpel, nor with the Word of God, which is a Hammer, and a Fire; and this is counted</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>by ſuch to be Yoaked, and Hammered down, and to be Reproved, and Rebuked, and Admoniſhed; this is</hi> Impoſition, <hi>and</hi> Over-driving, <hi>though the Power and Spirit of the Everlaſting God leads to it; which Spirit of God ſanctifies and exalts God, with a ſanctifyed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and reproves all that which diſhonours him, or would defile, and walks not in the Spirit, by which the Body of</hi> Chriſt <hi>is Baptized, and made to drink into. And the Spirit of God charged, and warned, and reproved all the Unruly; and charged the Faithful to ſtand faſt, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, as in the</hi> Scriptures <hi>may be plentifully ſeen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And what, Is this</hi> Impoſition <hi>and</hi> Force, <hi>(think you) which God's Spirit led the Prophets and Apoſtles unto, and had no Fellowſhip but with them that Walked in the ſame Spirit? Or, Will you ſay, There is not the ſame Holy-Ghost now, as was then? Yes, I must tell you the ſame; and all that keep in it, are in the Holy and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Fellowſhip; and it leads to the ſame Practice now, as then: And all ſuch as the Apoſtles admoniſhed, to have no Fellowſhip withal,</hi> (<hi>as in their</hi> Epiſtles, <hi>and in</hi> Jude) <hi>Might not thoſe have cryed</hi> Impoſition, <hi>as well as you?</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>And whereas thou ſpeakeſt of a</hi> New Way, and a New Form, carryed on with Church-Authority, <hi>&amp;c.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57559:239"/>This is the</hi> Prieſts <hi>Old</hi> Spirit, <hi>that uſed to tell us of our</hi> New Way, <hi>and,</hi> Where was our Religion Twenty Years ago? <hi>But our</hi> Way <hi>was before the</hi> Devil <hi>was, and all the</hi> Words Wayes, <hi>and all</hi> Apoſtates, <hi>and will be when they are gone; and this I tell Thee and Them.

And all Men and Women, that believe in his Light, and receive him, he gives them Power to become the Sons of</hi> God; <hi>and ſuch are Heirs of the Power, which is the Authority of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: And they ought freely to come and go to that which they are Heirs of, without your</hi> Impoſition <hi>or</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And all that receive him in the Light, he gives them Power, and they are Heirs of his Power, and his Life; So they are Heirs of the Authority of the</hi> Men <hi>and</hi> VVomens-Meetings; <hi>and every Man and Woman that is an Heir, has Right to the Authority; and they have taken their Poſſeſſions, and are taking their Poſſeſſions. And you, in your Separate Spirit from the Divine Light of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſay;</hi> Your Choſen Men, and them whom
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57559:239"/>you have given Power unto: <hi>And ſay,</hi> Uſurpers of Authority have come amongſt your Choſen Men, whom you have given no Power unto: <hi>And that,</hi> None ſhall ſit amongſt your Choſen Men, neither of your own County, nor others; but to tell their Meſſage, and go their wayes. <hi>And ſo, this kind of</hi> Church-Order <hi>amongſt you, (as you call it) is worſe than any</hi> Court, <hi>or</hi> Aſſizes, <hi>or</hi> Seſſions, <hi>or</hi> Courts. <hi>And much I could ſay to it; but you may read your</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>though you make a great Pretence of Liberty in it. But I have not heard yet of any, that like your Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that keep their Firſt Love and Habitation: And therefore, as I ſaid before, the Way to come into Unity, is to Condemn it all, and give over your Spirit of Strife, and Fightings, and come into that which did firſt Convince you; that by it you may be made true Members, and ſo come into Meekneſs and Unity: For I ſaw, many Years before I went forth, that ſuch ſhould riſe in Oppoſition; and ſo it is nothing to me, becauſe it is the ſame Spirit that hath riſen formerly in many others; and the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truth, and Goſpel of Peace is over it, and it is out of the Kingdom, that ſtands in Peace. And the efore, what I write, is for your Good; and it had been well for</hi> Thee, <hi>and</hi> You, <hi>had you taken what I writ before pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently: For I ſee, the more you ſtir, the more you will heap upon your own Heads; and the further ye will put your ſelves, except you come to Repentance, and come down in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57559:240"/>the Humility</hi> (<hi>for</hi> thee <hi>and</hi> you <hi>are too high</hi>) <hi>and I Judge this Spirit, as I ſaid before, and its Works, with the Spirit, and Light of Chriſt: For in the Spirit and Light of Chriſt is my Unity, that is atop of this Spirit; and its Works; and in that is my love to all for their everlaſting good, whether they will hear or forbear; and my Life is out of your Spirit of Strife, and over it; for the Seed of Life reigns, which had you kept in it, you would have ſeen me the ſame now, as I was in the beginning; and being gone from that, and gone into Doubts, Jealouſies, and Queſtions, and Evil Surmiſings (by which you are blinded) ſo as you ſee not me, as I was in the beginning, as many others have done the ſame before you; and when they are gone from the unlimited Spirit of Chriſt, then they are afraid to be limited.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And therefore, be adviſed, and come to judge that Spirit, leſt your Bonds be made ſtrong, and you grow worſe and worſe; and find not a Day of Repentance, and the Lord give you up to Hardneſs of Heart, and to your Hearts Luſts, and that your Latter-End be not worſe than your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; for it is the Univerſal Spirit and Life, that your Spirits fight againſt, which, as I ſaid before, God will blaſt. And ſo, mind your End; for it will manifeſt it ſelf, and has manifeſted it ſelf to all</hi> you <hi>that be in the Light, which, I fay once again, come unto, and condemn this Spirit, and its Works, and your Separation, that in it you may have Unity; for its out of the Paradiſe, in the Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>And I was grieved that the Glory of the Lord, which had appeared in the North, and his Name, ſhould be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by your croſs thwarting Spirit, and that You ſhould bring an Evil Report upon it into the South, of any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; but that was and is a true Word, You are got up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wrong Spirit, that is Rough and Courſe, which I feel and ſee, that is not ſavoury nor gracious, which had you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained your primitive Love, and Light and Faith, that works by Love, and been in the quiet meek Spirit, and the Goſpel of Peace, and in the Wiſdom that is peaceable, you would have ſought the Peace, or come to me, as I deſired You, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe things broke out (as I ſaid before) but you are of a High Lofty Spirit, which thoſe Vertues are over it, and they, and the Truth remain in themſelves, and amongſt them, that have right to them; but they have little place in You, till you come to that which will bring you to Condemn all the contrary; For though, you think you may get eaſe by Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Writing, but that will not eaſe you; for what you Sow, that you muſt Reap; for had they had place in You, you would have been preſerved in Peace.

                  <p>The Purport of <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi>'s Letter, we take to be chiefly, that <hi>G. F.</hi> might manifeſt <hi>Two</hi> Things: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Wherein</hi> John Wilkinſon, John Story, <hi>and ſuch as</hi> G.

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>G. F</hi>'s chief Matter (as we take it) produced againſt them, is this: <hi>How is the</hi> Lord <hi>ſanctifyed amongſt you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Paying of Tythes, or your Conniving at your Wives or others Paying for you?</hi> This amounts to a plain
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57559:242"/>Accuſation againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> &amp; others, (amongſt whom, it may reaſonably be taken, that he means <hi>John Story</hi> for one) <hi>Tythe-Payers,</hi> either by themſelves directly, or elſe by their Conniving at others Paying for them. 'Tis no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that <hi>G. F.</hi> is ſo generally Reputed amongſt <hi>Friends</hi> far and near, to report, that <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> are <hi>Tythe-Payers;</hi> ſince he hath written, with Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> &amp;c. touching <hi>Tythe,</hi> as afore-ſaid: But though he hath ſo done, yet 'tis a notorious Falſhood and Untruth; for <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been a great <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for Tythes,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was never known to evade his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the leaſt; or that his Wife, or any for him, ever paid

                           <p>John Wilkinſon, <hi>when he was firſt Convinc'd of Truth, had an Eſtate of Tenant-Right Land, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued between</hi> Fifteen <hi>and</hi> Twenty <hi>Pounds,</hi> per Annum; <hi>and ever ſince, (at Times and Seaſons) when he is at Home, exerciſes himſelf in Bodily Labour; ſometimes at Plow, and ſometimes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57559:243"/>his own State, when he writ his afore-ſaid Letter: <hi>For had he not been of a High and Lofty Spirit, he would not have reflected on them ſeveral times, as not loving the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace, becauſe they came not to him;</hi> eſpecially ſince 'twas not evident to their Conſciences, that he was free from having a Hand in the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Strife, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he would have had them come to him. The End whereof was (as we ſuppoſe) that they might have ſubmitted to his Sentence, or Judgment therein.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, Why did he not act the Part of a <hi>Good Shepherd,</hi> (according to the Parable, <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ninety Nine, to ſeek that which was Loſt</hi>) and ſeek after them; that ſo (if ſuch

                  <p>As to the <hi>Second</hi> Particular, <hi>viz. That</hi> G.

Alack for thee! If thou waſt in the Univerſal.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57559:244"/>know, what it would be at it ſelf, nor to what to bring others: And much I could ſay as to that.</hi> We now appeal to <hi>God</hi>'s Witneſs in all, Whether Men endued with that Wiſdom which is from Above, can be at Unity with ſuch a <hi>Scoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Shaffling, Impertinent Anſwer;</hi> wherein doubtleſs there is not leſs than Three or Four <hi>Falſhoods,</hi> and <hi>Untruths,</hi> in Two or Three Lines.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as to <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> with reſpect to theſe Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we have this to ſay; Our Experience tells us, he is not of an <hi>Impoſing Spirit;</hi> (unleſs Preaching the Word of Life, and Commending it to the Conſcience, may be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch, which cannot be) and hath approved himſelf wiſe in that Wiſdom that is from Above; and ſo knows what he would be at, and unto what to bring others, as his Doctrine and Converſation hath largely manifeſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis to be obſerved, that <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> in his afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Letter,</hi> (on the Occaſion of <hi>G.

                  </p>
                  <p>On this occaſion <hi>G. F.</hi> writes theſe following Sentences, <hi>But this is from a prejudiced malicious Spirit, and not from the Light of Chriſt, to Render my Weakneſs, when I am in my Grave turned to Duſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>So thou tells me, I am a Member of the Heavenly Body, yet thou ſay'ſt, when I am turned to Duſt, and Dead, ſurely this Doctrine proceeds from Darkneſs, and not from the Light of Christ: And is it to this thou wouldſt have me to bow, and be humbled? Nay,</hi> John, <hi>I need none of thy Miniſtry, it is an Angry, Malicious, Froward Spirit that hath poſſest thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On theſe Sentences we thus Obſerve, that they ſhew <hi>Malice, Envy, Perverſion,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>

                  <p>By his own Rule, his <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> appears, in rendring <hi>James Naylors</hi> weakneſs, and not only therein, but in joyning <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> with <hi>All the Evil Spirits in the VVorld,</hi> whoſe Doctrine, Life, and Converſation (ſo far as ever we knew) in all manner of Godlineſs, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, hath ſince his Convincement of Truth, rendred him worthy of <hi>double Honour</hi> amongſt many of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and his name <hi>G.

                  </p>
                  <p>As to his treating on the word <hi>Duſt,</hi> by way of Reffection on <hi>John Wilkinſons</hi> Miniſtry, and that from <hi>John Wilkinſons</hi> ſound words, the impartial Reader may eaſily diſcern his <hi>Perverſion,</hi> in concluding that <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> tells him, <hi>he (is a Member) of the heavenly Body,</hi> which doth not follow from <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi>'s Words, <hi>Be humble, as a Member of the heavenly Body,</hi> no more than it follows, that a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, is Chriſt, becauſe <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Whoſoever will be a perfect Diſciple ſhall be as his Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to his Ignorance or Darkneſs, 'tis thus Manifeſted; <hi>G. F</hi>'s aforeſaid Sentences cannot be a ſound Anſwer to any thing writ by <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> (which it ought to have been) unleſs <hi>G. F.</hi> concludes, that that <hi>Viſible Body</hi> (called <hi>George Fox</hi>) ſhall not turn to <hi>Duſt;</hi> becauſe <hi>John willinſon</hi> writ not his Letter to <hi>G.

                  <p>Moreover, 'tis to be obſerved, what ever <hi>G. F</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that caſe be, when he writ to <hi>John VVilkinſon,</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57559:246"/>he was willing to keep it to himſelf, becauſe he doth not plainly acknowledge that his Body ſhall ever turn to <hi>Duſt;</hi> but poſitively ſaith, <hi>That which</hi> John Wilkinſon <hi>ſtrikes at, ſhall never turn it to <hi>Duſt;</hi>
                     </hi> his meaning he beſt knows, but yet this we know, 'twas needful enough to have explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his meaning, becauſe the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13, 15, 19. <hi>The body is not for Fornication: Know ye not, that your Bodies are the Members of Chriſt? ſhall I then take the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of an Harlot?

                  </p>
                  <p>We now Query of <hi>G. F. whether theſe Bodies which the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>termed the</hi> Members of Chriſt's Body, <hi>were not the ſame in which the Holy Ghoſt dwells, and the Life of Jeſus was manifeſted? And if ſo, then</hi> (according to the Apoſtles Doctrine) <hi>Mortal and convertible unto <hi>Duſt.</hi> And whether or no an excluſion of all mortal Bodſes whatſoever, from being concerned as Members of the Church</hi> (which is Chriſts Body) <hi>be not the very ready way, whereby all</hi> Liberty <hi>and</hi> Looſeneſs <hi>that's pleaſing to the mortal Body, may be</hi> Indulged <hi>and</hi> Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed? <hi>And not only ſo, but whether the</hi> Men <hi>and</hi> VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meetings <hi>will not</hi> Fall <hi>of Courſe, and ſo no ſuch Places where thoſe who</hi> (as <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaith) <hi>are Heires of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, may go to in Order to the taking of their Poſſeſſions, as <hi>George Foxe's</hi> Language, in his aforeſaid Letter, is.</hi>

<note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>Meaning the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of the aforeſaid</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</note> ſecond Part in theſe words, viz. <hi>We indeed Declare and Teſtify, that our Senſe and Meaning in what we propoſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to Reunite the Meetings, was, not to hinder any Friends of ſtaying in the Meetings, who behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Men of Peace (as we Teſtified unto them in our Reply to their Anſwer to our Propoſals) but ſuch as inclined to cauſe Offences with raſh Cenſures, and falſe Judgments, which hath made, and will make Diviſions, contrary to the Doctrine we have Learned. If they had Objected againſt any thing in Love, which we propoſed, and with reſpect to the Honour of Truth, given us any Reaſon of its inconveniency, if we could
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57559:248"/>not have Convinced them of the Inconveniency thereof, with Weightier Reaſons; we ſhould readily have Conſented unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We now deſire the impartial Reader, ſeriouſly to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>whether our Perſwaſion aforeſaid is not on ſufficient Ground?</hi> And if ſo, then 'tis plain <hi>G. F.</hi> Reflects on his own Church-Order (as his Term is) as worſe than any Courts, Aſſizes, or Seſſions, by which we may in his own Language to <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> ſay, <hi>That he knows not what he would be at,</hi> if his Words and Writings may be taken to be his Real meaning at all times; but as to that we have no cauſe ſo to Conclude, becauſe we from this, and other his Words, Writings, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are ſufficiently ſatisfied, that he Concludes all wrong, and gone from the Light and Spirit, that are not at Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with what he ſaith, Acteth, and bringeth forth, though it be ever ſo Repugnant to Truth, and grounded on ever ſo falſe a Report and Scandal. And ſo, though he talks of the Unlimited Spirit, yet we are perſwaded, he would Limit every one to be ſubject to his Spirit; and that if they have not Faith therein, they are <hi>wrong,</hi> and in a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Spirit,</hi> from the Light, and Spirit, by which they were firſt Convinc'd: And on this Foot we do not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he concludes every one Wrong, that Conſcientiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may ask him any Queſtions for their Information, or Satisfaction touching him, concluding, that it doth ſpring from a Jealous Spirit, that ought not to be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing we think meet to take notice of in his aforeſaid Letter, is this, he Repeats <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi>'s Words thus, <hi>And whereas thou ſpeakeſt of a new Way, and a new Form, and carryed on with Church-Authority,</hi> &amp;c. And then in part of his Anſwer, thus ſaith; <hi>for I know no new Way, nor new Form, carried on with Church-Authority, as thou reproachfully; ſayeſt but hear thou haſt manifeſted thy ſeparate Spirit and Mind.</hi>

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57559:249"/>
                  <p>This manifeſts unto us, that <hi>G. F.</hi> (to uſe his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) doth ſo <hi>Jumble,</hi> that he knows not what he would be at; for <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> are (and as we take it in his Senſe) accounted the <hi>Church,</hi> and what they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on, is accounted to be carryed on by the Power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>G.

                  </p>
                  <p>That now this Church have introduced New Forms, or elſe <hi>G.

F.</hi> as <hi>G. F.</hi> is known to any one.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, his Denyal, that he knows of no <hi>New Form,</hi> carryed on with <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> is taken by us to be an abſolute <hi>Quibble, Shift,</hi> or <hi>Shuffle,</hi> if not a plain down-right <hi>Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Untruth.</hi>

                  <p>Having thus obſerved on <hi>G.

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a common and tude Saying, <hi>Prids oft times goes before a Fall:</hi> That <hi>G. F.</hi> is Fallen, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly proved in

                              <hi>WIth the Truth of</hi> God <hi>in my Heart, I have of late been greatly concerned, in the Remembrance of thee, in whom</hi> God <hi>appeared in the Beginning of the Day of Life, and reached unto us with his Word; who gave us Faith to believe, and to receive thy Teſtimony thou gave of his Light in our Hearts: which gathered us into Vnity with him, and one with another, and made us of the Church of the Firſt-Born, or of the Firſt Fruits unto</hi> God; <hi>continuing many Years in Love and Good-Will one to another: But of late Dayes, the</hi> Concord <hi>we once had, ſeems much to be broken; and many Inſtruments, whom</hi> God <hi>hath wrought by, (and in great Love have laboured together, but) of late time have greatly Iarred: And the Cauſe</hi> God <hi>hath manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me;</hi> That it is not in Principles of Truth, nor in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Doctrine, nor in any <hi>Practice,</hi> which Truth in the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Heavenly Body leadeth into; but about <hi>Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> from thee, through the Blind Zeal of the Weak, to promote thy Orders. <hi>It may be feared, many do eye more the</hi> Orders from thee, <hi>than they eye the</hi> Lord in them; <hi>Accuſing and Iudging all out of Truth, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57559:250"/>practiſe not with all freed from them, uſing all Force they can deviſe, according to the Power they have, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel all unto them;</hi> Cenſuring all Friends out of Unity, that come not to Practiſe with them; <hi>which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> Penalty <hi>and</hi> Perſecution <hi>they can inflict, for want of</hi> Ourward Power: <hi>And many Friends think it</hi> Godlineſs to Accuſe and Condemn their Brethren about Outward Things, before the Accuſed with Truth be led into them. George, <hi>for the Love of</hi> God, <hi>and for his Peoples ſake, open thy Mind plainly, what thou intended by them: and make it known unto Friends, if thou intended</hi> Counſel unto the Church only, <hi>and no</hi> Compelling into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Things to Practiſe, <hi>but commending to</hi> God<hi>'s <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in all Conſciences, to be led into the Exerciſe and Practice thereof, as every one is inwardly perſwaded of</hi>
                              </hi> God, <hi>in each particular, and not before: If thou ſo do, it would much clear Thee, and thy Orders, from being the Cauſe of Diviſion; for Iniquity worketh in a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in many, that think it Godlineſs to Accuſe and Condemn their Brethren about Outward Things, as I ſaid before, which was the Cauſe of great Strife in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages. But if thou open not thy Mind to Friends, and deal plainly, and teſtify,</hi> Thou never intended, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who is Faithful inwardly to <hi>God,</hi> ſhould either be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed or Condemned about thy Orders; and ſo let thy prudent Care appear about theſe Things; the Breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Friends and Brethren, is in great Danger to grow wider; <hi>and then, I fear, the Cauſe of Diviſions will lye at thy Door, which</hi> God <hi>Almighty, in his Mercy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and raiſe Thee up to put a Stop unto; for the Enemy of Truth hath taken occaſion from thy Orders, to work and beget a Falſe Birth in many, even</hi> Night-Viſions, <hi>and</hi> Falſe Propheſies, <hi>as the Number of Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and angry Proceedings about them of late declare,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57559:250"/>which was not before in our Age: Neither did Heads nor Horus of the</hi> Dragon <hi>appear, to caſt down the Holy People, by lying againſt them, ſaying,</hi> That they oppoſe the Holy Orders: <hi>And by approving of ſuch Proceedings, is</hi> Satan <hi>let loſe in our Time, to deceive; and all that ſee his Transformings, he caſts Flouds out of his Mouth againſt them, to carry them away, and caſts ſuch to the Earth; wanting nothing to effect his Deſigne, but the</hi> Outward Power <hi>to carry them on to Kill: For his Wrath is againſt them that keep the Teſtimony of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>and ſuch he accuſeth of</hi> Fleſhly Liberty, <hi>and</hi> Looſe Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>and of being</hi> Separatiſts <hi>and</hi> Hereticks. George, <hi>I deſire thee once again, to warn all Friends, that they neither</hi> Accuſe <hi>nor</hi> Condemn <hi>one another any more, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the afore-ſaid Things; for if that do continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Friends, it will cauſe a great Falling away, and</hi> God <hi>will viſit with great Iudgments that the</hi> Profeſſion of Great Power <hi>and</hi> Church-Authority, <hi>will not ſave from, while the</hi> Accuſer of the Brethren <hi>in ſuch (that is deeply in it) is not caſt down. It is not the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of</hi> Satan <hi>into a Shape of Auſterity, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power to fright the Simple into this or that</hi> Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Obſervation, <hi>we have waited for, nor laboured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nor a</hi> Feigned Profeſſion <hi>of overcoming Love in words, that can deceive us,</hi> (<hi>Bleſſed be</hi> God, <hi>for his Gifts of Light for ever more</hi>) <hi>when ſuch are bitterly ſmiting their Fellow-Servants, and filling Mens Minds with Falſe Accuſations, that even our Holy Profeſſion is defiled. What I deſire of thee, is not for fear of more</hi> Acouſations, <hi>nor</hi> Falſe Prophecies; <hi>they do not move me from the Hope of the Goſpel: But I deſire it for</hi> Thy Good, <hi>and the</hi> Churches Proſperity, <hi>and</hi> Peace. For an Image of the Government of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> conſiſting in Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Preſcriptions, attended with Force over the Inward
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57559:251"/>Man, we never expected in this Goſpel-Day, to bite and devour one another about; but the Inward and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Government of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to govern the Members of his own Body, (the true Church) into all Practices, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Godlineſs. <hi>And we are bound to follow him, our Redeemer, who knits together in the Autient Unity, and breaks not the Holy Fellowſhip amongſt Brethren. I have cleared my Conſcience, (which was concerned in the Remembrance of thee) deſiring thou mayſt quit thy ſelf with Truth in all Things, in thy latter Dayes, that thy End may be Crowned with True Honour.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>Thy Counſel hath often been to this purpoſe, <hi>Follow an Evil Report till the original Reporter be found, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the clearing of Truth, that ſo the Guilty Perſon</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                           </p>
                           <p>Now, whoſoever hath been the Reporter of a wrong thing againſt his Brother or Siſter, or hath refuſed to bring forth the Author of a Report that is reprovable, is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy own Counſel) Condemnable; and as it was ſaid by <hi>Nathan</hi> in another caſe to <hi>David</hi> (who to <hi>Nathan</hi> confeſt he had Sinned) <hi>Thou art the Man,</hi> ſo if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (as credible as any that ever I knew) be true, may it be ſaid of thee, <hi>Thou art the Man: Thomas Lower</hi> hath lately ſhown me a Certificate as Evidence that <hi>John Story</hi> upon the coming of Perſecutors to diſturb a Meeting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of it; and I perceive this is intended to render him a <hi>wrong Man;</hi> whereupon Iacquainted <hi>Thomas Lower</hi> to this effect, <hi>That if Report of thee was true, thou waſt in no meaſure leſs Gailty of ſuch a Crime, than</hi> John Story: he then Propoſed to me, <hi>To have it under my Hand;</hi> I told him, <hi>I would very freely ſo do, provided he would give it under his Hand, that if it was proved againſt thee, thou oughteſt to Judge and Condemn the ſame;</hi> this he would not do, which to me denoted either a <hi>Spirit of Partiality,</hi> or a ſort of <hi>Fear</hi> like unto that, that is taught by the <hi>Precepts of Men;</hi> and ſo I refuſed to Anſwer his deſire; yet I now give it under my Hand to thee; and my Plain end in ſhort is this, <hi>viz.</hi> in expectation to receive a <hi>Plain,</hi> and <hi>Satisfactory Anſwer</hi> from thee, that if it be poſſible, ſome ſort of <hi>Jealouſies</hi> may be removed out of my Mind, or elſe the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> thereof more confirmed; for 'tis a day wherein I account it my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be plain, without Reſpect of Perſons, and the Duty of none to reprove others for <hi>ſhuflers,</hi> and become <hi>ſhufters themſelves.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thoſe Scriptures which mention the words [<hi>Tradition</hi>
                              <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57559:254"/>and <hi>Examples</hi>] are in this Day or Age Strained to prove it <hi>Friends Duty to follow the Traditions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſome of the Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <p>Since therefore (as I ſaid before) <hi>Example is a better Teacher, than Precept,</hi> how can it be other than thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to endeavour the removing theſe ſtumbling Blocks out of the Way of <hi>God's</hi> People, by giving thy Teſtimony, <hi>That thou art not Guilty in either of theſe particular Things,</hi> if in Truth thou canſt do ſo? And by farther manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if it can be proved againſt thee, and made appear unto thee) that thou art ſo Guilty, that then <hi>Thou wilt Judge and Condemn the ſame,</hi> as that whereby thou haſt offended the Church of <hi>God;</hi> but if <hi>Clear in the Sight of God,</hi> thou may'ſt alſo be cleared in the <hi>Sight of his People;</hi> and thoſe who have reported ſuch things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee, may Judge and Condemn the ſame. I hope this <hi>Propoſition</hi> will not be look't upon by thee, and thoſe who contend for the Eſtabliſhment of an <hi>Outward Form of Government</hi> amongſt <hi>God's</hi> People at this Day, unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pen of the <hi>Meaneſt Member</hi> in the Body. But if it ſhould, I may juſtly appeal to <hi>God's</hi> Witneſs in all, whether that <hi>Outward form of Government,</hi> contended for both by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Printing,</hi> be ſuch, under which <hi>Equal Juſtice</hi> may be Adminiſtred to <hi>Every One,</hi> and the <hi>Infirmities of every Member of the Body be equally brought to Judgment.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If thou ſhouldſt look on my Lines as the Fruit of too great <hi>Preſumption,</hi> I have this to ſay, that what I now Write, is barely to clear my Conſcience; as in the ſight of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57559:254"/>God; and I am conſtrained in Spirit thus to do, knowing that not any ſuch <hi>Form of Government</hi> (wherein the Infirmities of every Member may not be Equally Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and brought to Judgment) can be the Form of <hi>Chriſts Government;</hi> nor yet that the ſeaſonable mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an <hi>Infirmity</hi> in an <hi>Elder Brother,</hi> can be accounted a <hi>departing from the Truth,</hi> and an <hi>Indication that ſuch ſhall never Proſper.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Whatever the Calumnies, and falſe Reports, raiſed on ſeveral Brethren may be, whereby, both they, and the Cauſe of Truth, may be rendred <hi>Ignominious,</hi> 'tis to be doubted that the ſecret Cauſe of all theſe late Commotions, which diſtract the Minds of many, ſprings from this; <hi>That ſome are eſteemed to <hi>Exalt</hi> Thee, above what is meet; that others are ecteemed to look on Thee, as <hi>Leſs</hi> than they ought; and that jealouſies enter many, that Thou eſteemeſt of thy ſelfe <hi>beyond</hi> what thou art.</hi> And if theſe, or at leaſt, ſome of theſe things be that ſecret Cauſe, and that Thou haſt <hi>no leſs eſteem</hi> than the Repute of an <hi>Elder Brother</hi> by all Friends (which, as far as I know, thou haſt not) how can it be leſs then thy Duty to <hi>interpoſe,</hi> that ſuch Differences as of late have ariſen, may no longer Live, to the Increaſe of Diviſion amongſt Gods Heritage: <hi>That ſo Records to Ages, and Generations to come, may not tell our Childrens Children, that that People who were clearly gathered out of all Outward Forms, Out-ward Heads, and Outward Laws, relating to the Inward-man, to the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver in themſelves, ſhould in ſo few Years, fall out concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Outward Orders, and the Head-ſhip of one Man;</hi> for ſo will it be Reputed, unleſs thou by <hi>Plain Teſtimony</hi> doſt Clear the ſame, by Manifeſting, <hi>that Thou never intendedſt, that what thou haſt given forth as Inſtructions, or Directions to the Churches, ſhould be urged with <hi>Severity</hi>
                              </hi>
                              <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57559:255"/>(which is no leſs than an <hi>Inforceing</hi>) upon any of Gods faithfull People; but rather <hi>commended them to the Churches,</hi> leaving the ſame to <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>leading Grace</hi> in his People, to make uſe thereof, as he ſhould Manifeſt a <hi>need of ſuch Direction, Counſel or Advice.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Many Antient Brethren beſides my ſelf, account this but a <hi>Reaſonable Propoſition,</hi> and that which we firmly believed, was according to thy Senſe, when thou Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velledſt among us, and gave forth ſeveral things; and yet thou mayſt remember, that when I was at <hi>Swarth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> I acquainted thee, that becauſe <hi>John Story</hi> had that very Senſe, it was ſaid of him, <hi>Truly</hi> John Story, <hi>thy Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Blindneſs is eaſily to be felt, and ſéen, and they muſt be very Dim of ſight, that ſée thée not. Oh the Confuſion thy Dark Spirit is in!</hi> Whereupon the Book, wherein it was ſo ſaid, was in thy Houſe brought forth, amongſt others, thy Wifes Son in Law was a ſubſcriber thereof; and when <hi>John Story</hi> his ſaid Senſe concerning thy giving forth ſome things was Read, and their Anſwers thereto, wherein the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Sentences concerning <hi>John Story</hi> were Read unto Thee, yet I never heard from thee, thy Wife, or her Son in Law, ſo much as one word <hi>diſapproving that Anſwer;</hi> but rather a <hi>Vindication</hi> thereof: Now whether this be not a juſt Cauſe of Jealouſy, and ſo thy duty in all plaineſs to Anſwer this matter, that ſo Jealouſies (which Friends are Exhorted to ſhut out, and for which they are accounted little leſs than Offenders) may be removed, let Gods Witneſs in every Conſcience Judge.</p>
                           <p>In the beginning of that day, wherein we were young, and firſt convinced, and turned to the Light, we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally came to know, <hi>That if we did walk according to what it did certainly Manifeſt unto us, we could not Err.</hi>
                              <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57559:255"/>But now I do know, 'tis the Labours of ſome (diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi>) by falſe Reports, to turn the minds of Brethren one againſt another, and this is not a turning the Mind to the Light, nor yet an Exhortation <hi>to keep within the Limits of its Leadings;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which is no ſafety; and ſo many young People growing up, and who are fit Objects for the Seed, to take Root in, have their minds much Exerciſed to conſider whether this <hi>Report</hi> of ſuch an one be <hi>True,</hi> or that <hi>Report</hi> concerning another <hi>Falſe,</hi> though neither of them <hi>True;</hi> and ſo through their Affection, or weakneſs of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (being too Credulous of other Mens Words, and too much affected with other mens Lines, made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to their Hands) joyn to <hi>one party,</hi> and deſpiſe <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and all this while (believing a <hi>falſe Report</hi>) are led by another Leader, than that whereby Gods people in the beginning were led, <hi>viz.

                              <hi>Antient Flock of God</hi> continue yet open, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the <hi>Whimſies</hi> and <hi>Imaginations</hi> that have entred ſome, whereby the Name of <hi>God</hi> hath been but too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blaſphemed, and the Word and Power of <hi>God</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably Abuſed, by ſuch whom the Papers ſeems to be a Strength to; which hath long ſince created Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, that the dread of that <hi>Antient Power</hi> (which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Brethren teſtifyed; <hi>Was with thee in the Beginning</hi>) is departed. The Conſideration whereof puts me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> That though thou and many have judged <hi>John Perrot,</hi> as an Apoſtatized Perſon from the Truth, for introducing a <hi>New Practice in the Church;</hi> yet thoſe who (as far as I know) ſtand in and for the ſame Faith and Practice they were in from the Beginning, are now judged Apoſtatized, becauſe they cannot imbrace (for Conſcience ſake) ſome <hi>New Preſcription,</hi> which thou art accounted either the <hi>Author,</hi> or <hi>Countenancer</hi> of.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> That though the Apoſtle thus exhorted; <hi>Little Children, keep your ſelves from Idols;</hi> yet thy Book touching <hi>Womens-Meetings,</hi> &amp;c. (very Scandalous to the Truth, and worthy in ſeveral Particulars to be Judged and Condemned) informs us, as if <hi>Micah</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpoken of <hi>Judges</hi> 17. (when ſhe gave Money to make a <hi>Graven Image to be Worſhipped</hi>) was a <hi>Virtuous Woman;</hi> for touching her thou haſt thus written: <hi>And Was not</hi> Micah's <hi>Mother a Virtuous Woman? Read</hi> Judges 17. <hi>and ſee what ſhe ſaid to her Son.</hi> And in a few Lines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thou thus teſtifyes; <hi>Theſe, and ſuch like Women are Recorded to Poſterity, for their Wiſdom and Virtue:</hi> See thy Book, <hi>Pag.</hi> 43, 44.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though there are Endeavours to ſend Papers to and fro, to beſpatter <hi>John Story,</hi> for going out of a Meeting when the Perſecutors came; yet I know, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57559:258"/>thou thy ſelf haſt been found in the like Action, and (if Reports be true) the frequenteſt of any Man, that ever I heard called by the Name of a <hi>Quaker:</hi> And 'tis to me a broad Signe, that this would not have been omitted, as a grand Article againſt him amongſt others at <hi>Drawel,</hi> hadſt not thou been Guilty in the like Caſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That though <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> are perſecuted by ſuch, unto whom thy Papers ſeem a Strength, becauſe they will not Condemn themſelves: Yet I never heard, that thou, as yet, haſt ever given forth any <hi>Paper of Condemnation</hi> for the <hi>Errors</hi> thou haſt Committed, in writing the Book about <hi>Womens Meeeting,</hi> &amp;c. or any thing elſe: Though I cannot believe, but that thou art Conſcious to thy ſelf, that Truth is ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed thereby; unleſs ſo great Imagination hath entred thee, as to conclude, <hi>That all thy Words, Writings and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are Right, becauſe they are brought forth through thy Earthly Veſſel.</hi> And to ſpeak plain, I muſt tell thee, Thou art not free from giving Occaſion to be Jealous, that thou doſt ſo conclude: Elſe, when I treated thee about the Buſineſs of <hi>Micha</hi>'s <hi>Mother,</hi> Why didſt thou tell me, as thou then didſt, <hi>viz. <hi>That thou kneweſt what thou didſt,</hi>
                              </hi> and that <hi>Thou ſaweſt 'twould be a Stumbling-Block?</hi> But rather, on the Sight of thy Miſtake, have ingeniouſly confeſt the ſame; for 'tis an <hi>Abominable thing</hi> in thee, or any Man <hi>knowingly to put Stumbling-Blocks in the Way of God</hi>'s <hi>People.</hi> And know this from me, thou wilt never be able to wipe away the Reproach that lyes upon thee, for writing that Book, until thou Condemn and Judge thy ſelf, for many things therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                           <p>And to be yet more plain; When I do conſider, that the Reputation and Reſpect, that hath been given unto
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57559:258"/>thee by many, (if not moſt of thoſe, who in the Parts here-a-way were firſt convinced of Truth) did firſt ſpring from the Teſtimony we had concerning thee, from the Mouths of thoſe whom we believed the <hi>Lord</hi> (and not Thou) ſent forth to gather us; it ſeems a very ſtrange Thing, and the Badge of a grand Apoſtacy: That any of the ſurviving Remnant of thoſe Antient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers (being as ſound in Doctrine and Principle, and as blameleſs in their outward Lives and Converſation, as in the Beginning, and thereby manifeſting themſelves Stayed in the <hi>Unchangeable Truth</hi>) ſhould be <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> and rendred <hi>Offenders,</hi> for that which Truth declares to be no Offence; and yet thou ſo far from being a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof thereto, that 'tis evident to me from my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had with thee at <hi>Swarthmore,</hi> and other things, that thou art become a Strength to them.</p>
                           <p>Haſt thou forgotten, that <hi>Truth</hi> was Preach't in the Beginning, under the Name of the <hi>Vnchangeable Truth?</hi> And, Is the Day now come, that a Remnant of the Antient Stock (who bore the Brunt, and Heat of the Day) muſt now be Perſecuted; whenas I am ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they could but now run with others to <hi>Change their Way,</hi> they might yet be eſteemed <hi>Good Friends?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Haſt thou forgotten, how often the Teſtimony of the Ancient Brethren were on this wiſe, <hi>We Preach not our ſelves, look not unto us, but unto the Appearance of Chriſt in your ſelves?</hi> And yet one Cauſe Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thee, that <hi>John VVilkinſon,</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> are wrong, is <hi>their not Coming to thee,</hi> and by the ſixty ſix Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers at <hi>Ellis Hook</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>London, <hi>their not Coming to Them?</hi>
                              </hi> Truly thoſe who have received their Miniſtry from God, are not to run hither and thither at thy Call, or any man's Call whatſoever; though I do know <hi>thou haſt</hi> (in a Letter written to me) <hi>Aſſigned their not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57559:259"/>coming to Thee, when thou ſend'ſt for them, to be as a Proof, that they were not Right, nor in the Light and Power of God.</hi> But by what Authority, or according to what Principle of Truth, Men, called of God into the Work of the Miniſtry, muſt be declared to be <hi>not right, nor in the Light and Power of God, becauſe they come not to Thee, when thou ſendeſt for them,</hi> I underſtand not: for thou in thy beſt Eſtate, waſt but a Member of the Chriſt of God, unto whom we are all to come, when he calls: And if any ſhall Affirm, <hi>that thou haſt, and doſt retain thy place,</hi> yet in that Caſe, Thou canſt be but a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, accountable unto the Chriſt of God, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Member of the Body (whereof Chriſt is Head) is?</p>
                           <p>Haſt thou forgotten, how Thou haſt Teſtified againſt <hi>James Naylor</hi>'s Spirit, whoſe great fall was <hi>his owning,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>not Reproving the Women,</hi> when they Cryed with a Carnal Tongue <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to him? And haſt Thou no Senſe, that its <hi>groſs Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>thick Darkneſs</hi> for any to look upon Thee, <hi>as that Prophet whom the Lord by his Servant</hi> Moſes <hi>Propheſied he would raiſe up, like unto him, whom the People are to hear in all things?</hi> I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thou art Ignorant, that ſuch there are, who ſo Look on thee; and I never underſtood thou becameſt a <hi>Reproof</hi> to this Spirit.</p>
                           <p>Haſt thou no Senſe, that the ſame <hi>Spirit of Ignorance,</hi> hath and can look upon that <hi>abominable Quotation,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Micahs Mother,</hi> as <hi>well enough,</hi> which, where-ever it is, doth undoubtedly Spring from this, that 'tis <hi>George's</hi> giving forth, and ſo there muſt be ſomething in it? And haſt Thou not been deſired to <hi>Clear</hi> things of this Nature, and to be a <hi>Reproof</hi> to ſuch Ignorance and Darkneſs, which tends to lead us into <hi>Egypt</hi> again? I am the man who have Cauſe to be Jealous, that there are ſome who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57559:259"/>look upon others either <hi>Apoſtatizing from the Truth,</hi> or <hi>ſtanding in ſlippery Places;</hi> when they find not a more than ordinary Reſpect for thee, I will not ſay, an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna</hi> in their Breaſts, as the Women had in their Mouths for <hi>James Naylor;</hi> and therefore I cannot but ſay, it might well become thee by a <hi>plain Teſtimony</hi> to Clear things of this Nature.</p>
                           <p>Many for Truth's ſake, and out of an indeared Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for thee in particular, and a Hope that theſe <hi>little Differences</hi> amongſt Friends might paſs over (and that thou wouldeſt uſe the Intereſt thou haſt in the Hearts of the Profeſſors of Truth, to quell thoſe many <hi>little Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which ſeemed ſome Moneths and Years paſt, but as ſparks of Fire) have born in a Spirit of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet now, ſince it is evident, that <hi>Ignorance, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> and <hi>Zeal without Knowledge,</hi> Joyn Hands together, to make War againſt Gods Servants, and that thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſeem a Strength thereto, therefore is the <hi>Zeal of the Lord of Hoſts</hi> kindled to War in Righteouſneſs againſt that <hi>Ungodly, Inſinuating Spirit,</hi> that makes it its buſineſs to beſpatter <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> whereby the Simple-hearted may be in danger to be turned out of the Way. <hi>'Tis unnatural amongſt the Heathen, for the Father to pierce and Wound his Children;</hi> Oh Friend! Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of that.</p>
                           <p>If thou art the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>chief Promoter</hi> of this <hi>War</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Antient Brethren,</hi> appear like a <hi>Man of War</hi> open-faced; and if thou art not, Remove the Jealouſies, that have entred the Breaſts of many concerning thee, which I know not how may be better done, than by a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>Candid Anſwer</hi> to this and the laſt Letter I writ thee, which I was conſtrained to write, to Clear my Conſcience; but thy not Anſwering my laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57559:260"/>ſhews plainly to me, that thou canſt not in Truth ſo Anſwer, as to keep thy ſelf from coming under the juſt Cenſure of Truth; for ſeveral Things which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſay are reported concerning thee, I know are <hi>True:</hi> And if ſuch things are <hi>Crimes in others,</hi> How comes it to paſs, that the like are not <hi>Crimes, when committed by thee?</hi> And therefore, ſince ſuch things have been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe, whom thy Papers ſeem a Strength to, as <hi>Crimes;</hi> I cannot tell how thou canſt ſhew thy ſelf at Unity with them, or they with thee, till by thine or their <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Condemnation,</hi> ye become Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled: For otherwiſe, either they will ſhew themſelves <hi>Wrong,</hi> or thou wilt appear as if in thy own Senſe, <hi>Thou wert Exempted from the Stroke of that Juſtice, which in the ſame Caſe is preſcribed for others.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And truly, <hi>Friend,</hi> 'tis much taken notice of, that <hi>All Reaſoning,</hi> and <hi>All Wiſdom</hi> is preach't againſt of late: Who would but think, that ſuch Men eſteem all ſorts of Ignorance and Unreaſonableneſs, to be Vertue? For my part, I meaſure not ſo; yet this meaſure I take, That when I find ſuch an one to uſe <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to evidence a <hi>Good Cauſe,</hi> I cannot but conclude, <hi>Such an ones Cauſe is ſtark Nought;</hi> when his beſt Argument to evidence it to be Good, is to cry out againſt <hi>All Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>All Reaſoning.</hi> Such an Argument I have not known to convince Men of Conſcience and Wiſdom, though ſome ſuch have, or may be, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> thus ſpeaks; <hi>How long, ye Simple Ones, will ye love Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and Fools hate Knowledge! Turn ye at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>One other Shift I have of late alſo obſerved, as a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to manifeſt a <hi>Bad Cauſe</hi> to be <hi>Good,</hi> viz. <hi>To get a Multitude of Hands to vilify Antient Brethren, when not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57559:260"/>heard to ſpeak for themſelves;</hi> as that Paper ſigned by <hi>Sixty-Six</hi> Perſons at <hi>Ellis Hook</hi>'s Chamber, againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>Jonn Story,</hi> doth evidence: For 'tis not Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to conclude, 'Twas given forth with reſpect to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Offence,</hi> but ſuch as hath been committed ſince the Meeting at <hi>Drawel;</hi> becauſe they have been once <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> already, for the Things there treated on.</p>
                           <p>And therefore, I cannot but ſay, Here the <hi>Arm of Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Egyptian Darkneſs</hi> meet together; and the <hi>Lord</hi> hath a Controverſy with thoſe who are guilty hereof; and the Blood of the Deceived thereby, may be required at their Hands. Oh! This Sin cryes aloud in the Ears of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> thus to endeavour the Defamation of <hi>God</hi>'s Servants, under fair plauſible Pretences of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Brokenneſs,</hi> or ſuch like, when ſo much Gall and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Spirit appears in the Bottom, that Men of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Conſcience cannot joyn thereto.</p>
                           <p>To be ſhort; Things are brought to that paſs amongſt us, that thoſe who contend for the <hi>Antient Principles of Truth,</hi> and to walk according to the Meaſure of Grace received, are now accounted <hi>Bad Spirits,</hi> by ſuch whom thy Papers ſeem a Strength to; though the Cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is nothing but <hi>Matters relating to their Conſciences,</hi> and not any thing of <hi>Evil Converſation:</hi> By which 'tis eaſily to be diſcerned, that Darkneſs is over-ſhadowing again, and the Glorious Light vailing. And though 'tis ſaid by ſome, <hi>That the Simple-honeſt-hearted Joyn in,</hi> and ſo makes as if the reſt were but <hi>Chaff,</hi> that are in the <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> and the <hi>Reaſonings,</hi> and the <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> I have this Faith, That there are Hundreds of <hi>God</hi>'s Antient Flock, who have retained their Firſt Love, are thoſe they call the <hi>Chaff;</hi> and many of thoſe who are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Wheat,</hi> are ſuch <hi>Chaff-Spirited People,</hi> who, had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57559:261"/>they not <hi>Outward Props</hi> to lean upon, and <hi>Outward Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to have an Eye unto, and <hi>Outward Papers,</hi> wherein they think their Cauſe is pleaded, would quickly loſe their Confidence, being Built upon the <hi>Foundation that is Sandy,</hi> and not on the <hi>Christ of God;</hi> for were their Faith in <hi>Him,</hi> their Faith would not ſtand in <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Men:</hi> And this with many (with whom <hi>Right Reaſon</hi> takes place, and the Wiſdom from Above is known) is plainly diſcerned.</p>
                           <p>Outward Forms and Precedents, eyeing others under the Notion of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> is ſo much diſcours't on of late by ſome ignorant Perſons, that 'tis but too evident, that the great Difference amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> is about <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Things</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> wherein ſome appear like People contending about the <hi>Shell,</hi> and loſe the <hi>Kirnel:</hi> Which occaſions me to tell thee, That when I have heard thee Preach againſt <hi>Auſtin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi>'s bringing into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a <hi>Snap-Sack of Ceremonies,</hi> (which I have at many Meetings heard from thee) I then little thought, I ſhould ever ſee the Day, wherein thou ſhouldſt appear a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancer of ſuch, who fall out with Antient <hi>Friends</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Outward Orders</hi> and <hi>Preſcriptions;</hi> but rather would have appeared a Strength to ſuch, who contend, that their Order for <hi>Goſpel-Diſcipline</hi> ought to ſpring from Truth within themſelves: For that was the undoubted Senſe of thoſe <hi>Honourable Brethren,</hi> who knew a Travel of Spirit for the Gathering of thoſe, who in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this latter Day were gathered, as a ſort of Firſt Fruits unto <hi>God;</hi> though ſome others coming in at the <hi>Eleventh Hour</hi> of the Day, and ſeeming as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by thee, appear of <hi>another Language.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I have this further to add; That if thou wouldſt be acquitted in the Breaſts of all Friends, <hi>As a Man that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57559:261"/>art not a Countenancer of ſuch Contentious-Spirited Men' that appear as the Beginners and Carriers on of this War;</hi> 'tis needful for thee to ſatisfy Friends, whether thou doſt own all the <hi>Forty-Four</hi> Articles, drawn up againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story.</hi> Thy Example of ſending thy <hi>Queſtions</hi> abroad to be ask't of <hi>other Friends,</hi> manifeſts, that 'tis reaſonable in <hi>another Friend,</hi> to expect an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>from Thee:</hi> But yet I have ſufficient Cauſe to doubt, thou wilt not be ſo plain, as to Anſwer the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;</hi> becauſe I cannot believe, but that thy Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is now ſo opened, as to ſee, that if thou own them, thou wilt bring thy ſelf under the Juſt Cenſure of Truth, for endeavouring to make any Brother an Offender for that which is no Offence: And if thou own them not, then thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf out of Unity with the great Oppoſers of <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>However, if thou refuſeſt to Anſwer, 'twill be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough, that thou walkeſt not by that <hi>Golden Rule, <hi>To do as thou wouldſt be done by.</hi>
                              </hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>More-over, Since thy Papers give Teſtimony againſt a Spirit, Why doſt thou not tell us in plain Words, who they are, in whom (according to thy Senſe) it works? For I much doubt, that if thou art not the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Mover to all this Strife; yet the want of the <hi>Right Application</hi> of ſome <hi>Expreſſions</hi> in thy Papers, teſtifying againſt <hi>Bad Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. is one great Cauſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of <hi>Bad Spirits,</hi> and of their Scribling. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be Plain-hearted: For I do know, that a <hi>dark, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Spirit</hi> is entred, and under the <hi>Outward Profeſſion of Truth:</hi> and that alſo, ſuch a Spirit appears amongſt thoſe, who eſpouſe the Cauſe againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story;</hi> and the Fruits that are brought forth by them, which evidence that they are of ſuch a Spirit,

                           </p>
                           <p>One thing more lyes upon me to ſay unto thee; That though amongſt the Princes of the World, there are ſuch Politick Contrivances to carry on their Deſigns, as to ingage ſuch others therein; who for <hi>Self-Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> become of a <hi>Temporizing Spirit,</hi> or for want of the Things of this World, are ready to follow for the Loaves; for being of a Mean Spirit, are Hurried or Over-awed with Fear: And ſo, if their Deſignes ſucceed ill, then 'tis the Fruit either of Evil Counſel, or ill Management; but if well, then they carry away the Glory thereof:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57559:263"/>Yet it becomes not any one, or many, profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Members of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body, thus to do.</p>
                           <p>And now to Conclude; I have this further to Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>VVhether thou Conclude thy ſelf no way obliged to bring thy VVritings to the Second Dayes Meeting in</hi> London, <hi>to be approved of there, before they be Printed?</hi> If thou doſt not, <hi>Thou haſt been wrong Repreſented;</hi> if thou doſt, and yet think'ſt all other Friends are, (as 'tis to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thou doſt; for I have never heard, that thy Book about <hi>VVomens Meeting</hi> was there approved, or that all the Things therein contained, will be ſtood by, or owned by any one Friend in Truth) then 'tis an evident Token, <hi>Thou wouldſt Exalt thy ſelf:</hi> For, What is that leſs than to conclude, That the <hi>Infallible Spirit is limited to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear through thy Earthen Veſſel only?</hi> For if (according to the Principle of Truth) the <hi>Spirit is the Judge,</hi> and that its pouring forth in our Day, is upon <hi>many Sons, and many Daughters;</hi> Why then ſhould not the Appearance of the Spirit, through any Veſſel, have its free Paſſage, as well as through Thine?

But to return; I have this further to ſay, That if Thou or any are ſo imaginary, as to conclude, That all thy Writings and Books are given forth by the <hi>Infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and that as ſuch they ought to be made uſe of, (a part of which, I am ſatisfyed, have ſo been, thereby to obtain Proſelytes againſt <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John VVilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>) it appears to me, as if thy Notorious Erring from the <hi>Infallible Spirit,</hi> in writing ſome things contained in thy Book of <hi>VVomens-Meetings,</hi> hath been permitted to be as an Evidence Recorded againſt all ſuch, who igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly look upon thee ſo to be, as afore-ſaid: And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57559:263"/>therefore, it becomes thee to be <hi>Humbled before the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>Acknowledge thy Errors therein.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I am not without a Senſe, what Entertainment my plain Dealing will have amongſt many, if thou ſuffer it to be read or ſpread amongſt any Prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, as thou didſt my laſt <hi>Letter;</hi> whereby I became Judged, before Treated withal, either by Thee, or any touching the ſame: However this gives me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that I have <hi>Counted the Coſt;</hi> and if I muſt be <hi>Reproach't</hi> (as once I have been already) for clearing my Conſcience to thee, yet as I now have, ſo my Faith is, I ſhall have <hi>Peace of Conſcience,</hi> when the <hi>Neglect</hi> thereof would have become my <hi>Burthen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And if any for this Cauſe ſhould give forth ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers againſt me, as are undeſervedly given forth againſt other Friends in Truth, and that alſo by ſuch, who have not heard them ſpeak for themſelves, 'twill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to their Shame, as in the End will undoubtedly be more publickly manifeſted.</p>

                  <p>To the Two afore-ſaid <hi>Letters,</hi> I never received any Anſwer in Writing, nor yet by Word of Mouth, as ever I remember, more than to this Effect: William, <hi>If thou wilt take thy Letter back again, 'tis well enough,</hi> or ſuch like Words. But yet, on <hi>G.

F.</hi> refuſed to Anſwer, and ſo the Meeting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>I now come to take Notice, that there was a Paper gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth from <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi> his Chamber, by <hi>Charles Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall,</hi> and <hi>Sixty-Five</hi> Perſons more, as a Teſtimony againſt <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> to which Two Anſwers were written; and not only ſo, but a Teſtimony from <hi>John Jonnings,</hi> and about <hi>Seventy Friends</hi> more in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Wilts,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Gouldeny, William Ford,</hi> and <hi>My Self,</hi> together with <hi>Sixteen Friends</hi> beſides in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> againſt it.</p>
                  <p>This I make mention of, becauſe that Paper from <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Hooks</hi> his Chamber, ſigned by <hi>Charles Marſhal,</hi> &amp;c. hath proved but Fuel added to the Fire of Contention, that was Burning before.</p>
                  <p>Now, foraſmuch as I am well ſenſible, that <hi>G. F.</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems himſelf One having the Care of all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es upon him; and that <hi>John Story</hi> poſitively affirms, that when he was at <hi>Worceſter</hi> with <hi>George Fox, He,</hi> viz. <hi>G. F.</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:57559:264"/>did then tell him, (which he took as Threatning) <hi>Friends would Write againſt them, and that the Power of</hi> God <hi>would caſt them out,</hi> meaning <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story:</hi> It may be needful for <hi>G. F.</hi> to give an Account, how he came to be ſo careleſs of the Churches, as not ſo to ſift into that Matter, as that the Unrighteous Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof might have been Judged, eſpecially fince he was then in <hi>London:</hi> The Neglect whereof in him, (ſo Circumſtantiated, as he accounts himſelf to be) occaſions this Jealouſy, That he was an Approver of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Method of their Proceedings; and ſo may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a Fulfilling of the Words cited, as ſpoken to <hi>John Story</hi> at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> viz. <hi>That Friends would write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and the Power of</hi> God <hi>would cast them out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fire of Contention thus increaſing, and it being rumour'd, that there was a <hi>Separate - Meeting</hi> in the <hi>North; John Story</hi> writes unto the Two Meetings in the <hi>North, viz.</hi> that called <hi>Separate</hi> and that called <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly;</hi> therein propoſing Expedients for a <hi>Re-uniting,</hi> which was Recommended by <hi>Thomas Gouldeny,</hi> and <hi>My Self,</hi> together with <hi>Sixty Friends</hi> beſides; and was Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by thoſe called <hi>Separate,</hi> as by their Teſtimony, ſigned by <hi>VVilliam Cartmell,</hi> and <hi>Fifty-Seven</hi> Perſons more, appears: But <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> and <hi>Fifteen</hi> others of the <hi>Quarterly-Meeting,</hi> ſo termed, Condemned <hi>John Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Propoſition, before heard, as by their Anſwer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
                  <p>This alſo is thus hinted, becauſe I doubt not, but that it may come to the View of <hi>Robert Barrow;</hi> who (if he pleaſe) may thereupon take Occaſion to ſignify to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57559:265"/>me, <hi>That</hi> George Fox <hi>was not concerned in that Council;</hi> if in Truth, he can ſo ſignify.</p>
                  <p>This I propoſe, becauſe 'tis jealouſed, That Matters of no leſs Moment, are not very commonly Reſolved upon by <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> and others of Party with <hi>G.

                     <p>At the firſt view, this ſeemed ſo abominable a Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prove the Aſſemblies of purified women, under the Goſpel diſtinct form purified men to be neceſſary (which is the end wherefore 'twas (as we take it) quoted) that we were concerned to inform our ſelves from the Scriptures, to what end women aſſembled before the Door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Congregation; and we find by a Marginal Note in the Scriptures that it was (as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> write) after their Travel, when they came to be purified, as in <hi>Leviticus</hi> the 12th and 6th, where it's thus ſaid. <hi>Now when the dayes of her purifying are fulfilled, ſhe ſhall bring to the Prieſt a Lamb of one year old for a Burnt-Offering, and a young Pigeon or Turtle Dove for a Sin-Offering, unto the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation;</hi> which gives us occaſion thus to query.</p>
                     <p>How can Women, coming in order to their Purification with a Sin-Offering, &amp;c. to the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, when defiled by the Men, that there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed them, be a Proof for purified Women under the Goſpel, to aſſemble together diſtinct from purified men?</p>

                     <p>This we take to be a Quotation to evidence Womens ſpeaking in the Church to be according to truth; but yet we cannot own it to be much (if any thing at all) bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Argument for <hi>VVomens ſpeaking in the Church</hi> of God, when the Church is met to worſhip the Lord in his Spirit, than <hi>Womens Diſcourſes with their Husbands about their outward eſtates,</hi> doth almoſt every day produce amongſt us; and were it ſo that no better Argument could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the juſtification of <hi>Womens ſpeaking in the Church of God</hi> (in the ſenſe we have underſtood ſpeaking in the Church) we might be aſhamed of our Principle and their Practice.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Our obſervation now is. <hi>Jeptha</hi> made a vow unto the Lord, and thus ſaid, <hi>If thou ſhalt deliver the Children of</hi> Ammon <hi>into my Hand, then that thing that cometh out of the Doors of my houſe to meet me, when I come home in peace from the Children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>ſhall be the Lords, and I will offer it for a Burnt-Offering. And ſo it happened that his only Child being a Daughter, came out to meet him with Timbrels and Dances, and when he ſaw her, he rent his Cloaths and ſaid, alas my Daughter! but yet at the end of two months, did unto her according to his Vow, having given her two months time, to go to the Mountains with other Virgins to bewail her Virginity; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became a cuſtom in</hi> Iſrael <hi>to go Yearly to the Mountains to bewail the Daughter of</hi> Jeptha.</p>
                     <p>This occaſions us to query, whether ſuch a meeting oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned on the Untimely Death of a Virgin (for <hi>Jeptha's
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57559:269"/>Vow</hi> was a <hi>Raſh Vow</hi>) can be any Evidence of the Matter, which is taken by us to be intended, <hi>viz.</hi> either for <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſpeaking in the Church,</hi> or <hi>Womens Meeting diſtinct from Men</hi> on the account of worſhip to God, or perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Acts of Government, relating to Church Diſcipline?</p>
                     <p>Several other paſſages are contained in the ſaid book, which we take to be in order to prove either <hi>womens ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church,</hi> when ſolemnly met together to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord to worſhip him in the Spirit; or <hi>VVomens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct meeting on account either of Worſhip, or exerciſe of Diſcipline in the Church of God,</hi> as in divers places of the ſaid book may appear; but yet we are diſſatisfied, that they are pertinent to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>We find by a Paper given forth by <hi>G. F.</hi> that he thus writes, <q rend="margQuotes">
                           <hi>Friends, to you all this is the VVord of the Lord; take heed of judging one another, and judge not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I command you in the Preſence of the Lord, neither lay open one anothers weakneſs behind one anothers backs; for thou that doſt ſo, art one of</hi> Ham<hi>'s Family, which is under the curſe, and that there be no backbiting behind one anothers backs, but love, and ſo the ſame that doth condemn behind the back is for Condemnation with the Light.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This brings to our remembrance what <hi>Paul</hi> writ unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> chap. 2. ver. 1. therefore thou art inexcuſable, <hi>Oh man whoſoever thou art that judgeſt another; for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf: for thou that judgeſt. doeſt the ſame thing; but we are ſure that the Judgment of God is, according to Truth, againſt them that commit ſuch things; and thinkest thou this, oh man, that judgest them which do ſuch things, and doſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the Judgment of God?</hi> From hence we obſerve:</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt, That unleſs <hi>G. F.</hi> pleads that he is <hi>more than a man,</hi> and on that foot claims a Priviledge that he may give <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57559:276"/>concerning me, and thoſe whom he accounts <hi>concerned</hi> in ſpreading the <hi>Narrative,</hi> made mention of, juſtly applied to me, I ſhould then blame no man refuſing on that foot to commerce or trade with me. And if ſo be his unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſhould have ſuch an Influence, as that all ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Commerce with me, what might become of Me, my Wife and Children, whom, 'tis well known, I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to comfortably maintained by my Induſtry as a <hi>Merchant,</hi> and been able to be aſſiſting unto others in my generation? May the God of heaven abate the pride of <hi>G.

                     <p>The Reader may now take notice, that ſince the time <hi>William Rogers</hi> hath been ſo much concerned in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to this Controverſie, Perſecution aroſe at the Meeting whereto he belongs in <hi>Gloceſter-ſhire,</hi> viz. <hi>Olve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> and to prevent the Informers (who raiſed the Perſecution
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57559:276"/>for no other end but to Enrich themſelves, as is notoriouſly manifeſted) from making a Prey upon all his moveable Goods, in that Place, he ſecured a part thereof which lay without Doors, having unſecured Within and Without to the value of about three hundred pounds, which lay Subject to the Spoilers at the place of his Reſidence; that ſo none ſhould ſuffer either for him or his family: On this occaſion Reports ſuddenly ſpread abroad, that <hi>William Rogers</hi> had now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf of what Spirit he was of, and was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by his Enemies (under the Name of Friends) that he would not ſuffer a Groat, and that others were fined for him, if not paid Fines for him, which was very <hi>falſe;</hi> for that he affirms, the Fines laid on him exceed ninety, if not an hundred pounds; and that a part thereof is levyed on his Goods without Doors, and never returned, but ſold away to an Enemy to Friends.</p>
                     <p>This we thought Neceſſary to inſert, becauſe we do not doubt, but that the Cauſe of Truth hath ſuffered, through the Belief of Lying Reports relating to him; for when a Mare of twelve pounds value was diſtrained from him, 'twas ſuddenly Reported, that he cauſed his man to buy her again, which was utterly <hi>falſe;</hi> for that the Mare was ſold by the Diſtrainer to an Enemy to Friends and Truth, that kept the Mare for his own Uſe.</p>
                     <p>On this Occaſion we think meet to recite a Paper, given forth by <hi>G. F.</hi> touching ſecuring of Worldly Eſtate in time of Perſecution, together with an Anſwer thereto by <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Rogers.</hi>

                                 <p>Anſ. <hi>To the Exhortation I ſay, 'tis in itſelf good, but would have much better become the Mouth of</hi> G. F. <hi>if when the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors came up one pair of Stairs in our Meeting-Room in</hi> Broadmead, <hi>whilſt he was ſpeaking, he had not been of ſuch a Spirit (which ſome may term Diſtruſtful and Deſpairing)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57559:278"/>as on a ſudden to ſtep down, and haſten out of the Meeting at a Back pair of Stairs, which he once did, and of which my Eyes (with many more) were witneſſes: Beſides, I query of</hi> G.

For ſo have I been informed he did, and that by a perſon of known Credit and Repute then preſent at the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who, as he ſaid, had diſcourſed with him at that time and place, near half an hour; and if Report be true, this is but very little of what might at large be manifeſted to prove him one of the greateſt Fleers and Shifters in time of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that ever I knew profesſing the Truth, and eſteemed by others a faithful Friend.</hi>

                                    <hi>As to the queries, I have this to ſay, that the Earth is the Lord's, that he giveth the Encreaſe; that 'tis a nearer thing to part with Life than Eſtate; that 'tis the Duty of a Chriſtian to offer up both Life and Eſtate, rather than to depart from his Teſtimony for the Truth, when the Lord calls for it: I am alſo ſenſible, there is a Spirit that luſteth to Envy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſuch, that would lay heavy Burthens on others, but not touch them with their little Fingers themſelves; and that this is not the Spirit of God, nor his Wisdom; but that which is Earthly, Senſual, and that would have its Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I am alſo ſenſible, that this very Spirit hath lately, and yet doth dwell in</hi> G. F. <hi>if God hath not given him Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And therefore if any of you, unto whom theſe Lines may come, may think, that this my ſenſe of</hi> G.

                     <p>The aforeſaid anſwer was read in the Mens Meeting of Friends of the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> at which ſome of the Party with <hi>G.

F.</hi> appeared to appoint a Meeting; the ſecret Cauſe whereof, we believe, was, becauſe that ſome of the Party with him were conſcious to themſelves, that <hi>G. F.</hi> in many things, was repreſented no otherwiſe than he had manifeſted himſelf to be. Thus far the Citation out of the 15th Section of the 2d. part of the ſaid Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</p>
                     <p>To the aforeſaid <hi>Anſwer</hi> and <hi>Queries</hi> given by me, <hi>G.F.</hi> made a <hi>Reply</hi> with a <hi>Falſe Certificate,</hi> (as hereafter will be mentioned) annexed thereto by <hi>John Blaykling,</hi> unto which I writ a <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> and cauſed the ſame to be copyed, and

                     <p>ON the 21th of the firſt Month, 1678. Was delivered me a Manuſcript, ſubſcribed <hi>G. F.</hi> with a <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> ſubſcribed, <hi>John Blaykling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is therein written, and ſubſcribed <hi>G. F.</hi> is a <hi>Reply</hi> to an Anſwer that I gave toa Paper given forth by <hi>G. F.</hi> dated the 4th Month, 1678. which was read in the Mens Meeting of Friends in the City of <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And foraſmuch as <hi>G. F.</hi> hath laid down two <hi>Falſe Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> on which he ſeems to build the greateſt part (if not all) of thoſe things which he concludes are <hi>Falſe Charges,</hi> I ſhall apply my ſelf to manifeſt thoſe two <hi>Falſe Aſſertions,</hi> and ſo the Force of his <hi>ſix ſheets</hi> of Paper, (in anſwer to one of mine) will for the moſt part (if not altogether) fall to the ground, as ſuch an impertinent idle diſcourſe, that's nauſeous to men of Honeſty, and endued with Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs it be the Fruit of Underſtanding, and Honeſty (which I know is not, nor can be) to give credit unto the words of a Man, detectable of many <hi>Lyes</hi> from the ſight of his own Reply, and compared with what he pretends to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, 'tis obſervable, that he not only praiſeth himſelf at a high rate, but alſo vilifieth and ſcandalizeth others in general terms, and ſometimes in particular, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57559:283"/>yet brings <hi>no proof</hi> for either; to me it appears, that his beſt skill to anſwer any thing, is (of late) ſo manifeſted, which cannot but be obvious to every impartial Eye, that ſhall throughly peruſe, and ponder his Anſwer to me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>G. F</hi>'s firſt <hi>Falſe Aſſertion</hi> hinted at, as before, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in theſe his words, <hi>viz. [My Paper is an Epiſtle to Friends, which thou confeſſeſt, is an Exhortation in itſelf good.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I <hi>Reply,</hi> this Sentence and Aſſertion is Falſe, and not to be found in my Anſwer to him; my own words, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to an <hi>Exhortation in itſelf good,</hi> is, in my <hi>Anſwer,</hi> to be found only in theſe two Sentences, <hi>viz. The above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited Paper I take to be wholly made up of Queries, to all thoſe, that make away their Eſtates for fear of the Spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in time of Perſecution; excepting this one Sentence of Exhortation, Do you not diſtruſt and deſpair of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, his Protecting and Delivering you with his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power? to the Exhortation, I ſay, it is in itſelf good,</hi> &amp;c. Which plainly relates to that one ſentence, which I took to be an Exhortation, but not to all his Paper, which he terms an <hi>Epiſtle to Friends.</hi> From <hi>G. F</hi>'s words, <hi>viz. An Epiſtle to Friends,</hi> ſuch as have not heard what is contained in the ſaid paper, may be apt to conclude, that it contains ſomething of <hi>Exhortation, Counſel, Doctrine, Inſtruction, Teaching, Propheſying,</hi> or <hi>Prayer,</hi> or at leaſt ſome Sentences; which imports his being then exerciſed in ſome, or one of the aforementioned ſpiritual gifts: but no ſuch thing is therein found, more than what may be pretended from the aforeſaid ſentence of <hi>Exhortation</hi> (as I took it) but that Sentence may alſo be taken for a <hi>Query,</hi> as well as an <hi>Exhortation.</hi> And as to the reſt of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, 'tis all Queries, which gives me occaſion to ask this queſtion, <hi>viz. Whether ſuch a Paper can properly be called, an Epiſtle to Friends in Truth?</hi> eſpecially ſince 'tis eaſily
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57559:284"/>ſavoured, that thoſe he writes to are ſuch, as in his eſteem are exerciſed in the ſpirit of the World, that luſteth to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; for ſo his words clearly import, if one of his Queries, and the beginning of his paper be compared; the beginning of his paper runs thus; <hi>Friends, all you that do make away, or over your Eſtates,</hi> &amp;c. and then about the middle of his queries thus ſaith, <hi>Whether this ſpirit that doth ſo, is not the Spirit of the World, that doth luſt to Envy?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, as to this Falſe Aſſertion; <hi>G F.</hi> hath ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſubſtance thereof in at leaſt, eight ſeveral places, in his Anſwer to me, which to ſpeak in plain and vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is one downright <hi>Lye,</hi> told eight times over; and ſince in the ſecond Page of the ſaid <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> he ſeems to imply, that I have not been <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ingenuous as a Man,</hi> I now appeal to all <hi>ingenuous Readers,</hi> whether this his Action ſhews any degree of <hi>Civility,</hi> or <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> either as a <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond Falſe Aſſertion before hinted at, I thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; I propoſed <hi>Thirteen Queries</hi> to him, after I had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſubſtance of his <hi>Queries,</hi> and having ſo done, I then proceeded to add, and that in a diſtinct Paragraph from the Queries, theſe few following lines, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           <hi>The aforeſaid queries, my deſire is, that thou</hi> George Fox <hi>mayeſt anſwer, that ſo the ſimple-hearted Friends may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, what thy Iudgment is in things of this nature; for I have cauſe to believe that many ſuch are at this day drawn into the Belief and Practice of ſome things, for which they have no ſufficient ground from the Conviction of Conſcience in themſelves; but rather as prompted thereto by ſuch, who are like unto thoſe, who lay heavy Burthens on others, which they themſelves will not touch with their little fingers; but bleſſed be the Lord, there are Eyes that ſee and do perceive, there are Ears that hear and do underſtand, and have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Confidence given them of the Lord, to ſtand in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57559:284"/>Gap, as Witneſſes againſt ſuch, who cry againſt</hi> Fleers in time of Perſecution, <hi>and yet, are</hi> Fleers at ſuch times themſelves; <hi>that blame others for</hi> ſecuring of their Goods from the Spoilers, <hi>and yet</hi> Secure their own; <hi>that prompt the</hi> Poor <hi>to offer up their</hi> ALL, <hi>and yet take Care to adviſe the</hi> Rich to ſecure their Eſtates; <hi>that cry againſt others as</hi> Unruly, <hi>becauſe they will not be ſubject to them, and yet</hi> think themſelves not obliged to be ſubject to any Rule, but their own; <hi>that re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

F. <hi>hath done; that would be accounted</hi> Watch-men, watching for Good, Healers of Breaches, Removers of Stumbling-blocks; <hi>and yet appear</hi> Watchers for Evil, and not for Good; Increaſers of Differences, <hi>by adding Fewel to the Fire, and</hi> caſting Stumbling-blocks in the way of the Simple; <hi>that appear Reprovers of ſuch to,</hi> Tythe-Payers, <hi>who ever bore a</hi> Faithful Teſtimony againſt it, <hi>and yet</hi> adviſe others to buy their Tythes; <hi>that ſay,</hi> God hath given them Infallible judgment in all things, <hi>and yet appear notoriouſly Fallible. How far thou</hi> G.F. <hi>art concerned in ſuch things as theſe, will appear in the day of the Lord, when every mans</hi> Words <hi>and</hi> Works <hi>muſt be brought to judgment; for I ſirmly believe, thou art the man that haſt been guilty in all theſe things.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>From theſe laſt words <hi>George Fox,</hi> Page the ſecond, thus ſaith, <hi>And thou haſt many queries upon my Epiſtle, and on thy concluſion ſayeſt; Thou believeſt, that I am the Man that is guilty of them all.</hi> So by this it appears, they are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57559:285"/>charges againſt me: This Conſtruction of <hi>G. F.</hi> is utterly wrong; for my words, from whence he draws that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cannot in common ſenſe, and according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of words, ſo import, they being only relative to the preceding matter, contained in a diſtinct Paragraph, after I had done with the <hi>Queries:</hi> but yet I would not have any to think, that I asked one Queſtion, as having no ground ſo to query.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, 'tis obſervable, my aforeſaid words will not amount unto a Charge, becauſe to <hi>believe</hi> and to <hi>charge</hi> are two diſtinct things; for a man may <hi>believe a Charge,</hi> and yet have <hi>no hand in giving the Charge;</hi> but a man cannot honeſtly <hi>charge</hi> another, and yet pretend <hi>he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Charge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>G. F</hi>'s manifeſted Weakneſs doth not end here; for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his <hi>Conſtruction</hi> had been my <hi>Meaning,</hi> he might then have juſtly accuſed me of Folly; but not juſtly have rendred me one charging him with <hi>Falſe Accuſations</hi> (as on this occaſion he hath done) ſince the <hi>Queries</hi> were not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, without which no certain Accuſation could be really manifeſted, becauſe queſtions may be anſwered in Truth, ſometimes by <hi>Yea,</hi> and ſometimes by <hi>Nay:</hi> On this <hi>falſe Aſſertion</hi> G. F. is become guilty of as many Lyes, as my <hi>Queries</hi> before propoſed are in number, <hi>viz. thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</hi> Beſides, if <hi>G. F</hi>'s Judgment, manifeſt in his reply, touching me <hi>(viz. That I have manifeſted Madneſs and Folly)</hi> were true, yet my <hi>Folly</hi> hath not been ſo great, as to write <hi>one Lye eight times over,</hi> and <hi>thirteen particular Lyes</hi> (and all on the foot of two <hi>Falſe Aſſertions</hi>) beſides many more, as hereafter in this my reply will appear (and that alſo dotectable from the view of my <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> thereto) as he hath done. I will not adventure to ſay this, <hi>in him was the Fruit of Madneſs and Folly;</hi> though 'tis evident, he doth not heed what he writes; and in the moſt charitable Conſtruction, that I can put thereon, the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57559:285"/>Reaſon he ſo doth (as I take it) ſprings from an <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> poſſeſſing his heart, that he concludes whatever firſt ariſes in his mind (on the ſight or hearing of any thing) is fit to be brought forth, and ſtood by. And truly, 'tis to be doubted, the like <hi>Imagination</hi> hath poſſeſſed many (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom I take <hi>John Blaykling</hi> to be one, by giving forth a <hi>Falſe Certificate</hi>) to cover <hi>G. F.</hi> in his Defence of a <hi>Lye</hi> againſt the Truth; of which more anon.</p>
                     <p>I now come to ſignifie that <hi>G. F</hi>'s ſending thoſe <hi>Queries,</hi> was more like the Action of a <hi>Friend</hi> to a company of <hi>Hireling Prieſts,</hi> than the Action of one <hi>Friend</hi> to a <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Friends,</hi> accounted by ſome the <hi>Church,</hi> and that what I writ by way of Anſwer to him by name, was more plain than his ſmiting in general terms, ſo far as <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> may be called <hi>Smiting.</hi> Neither was my reading my Anſwer in the <hi>Mens Meeting</hi> againſt my former declared ſenſe and Judgment, though <hi>G. F.</hi> doth ſo inſinuate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing the caſe of <hi>Thomas Cam,</hi> which is remote from his purpoſe; 1. Becauſe <hi>Thomas Cam</hi> was never oppoſed by me, or any that I know of, to read any Paper in the <hi>Mens, Meeting.</hi> And 2. when an Agreement was appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Thomas Cam</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> in order to prove <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> an <hi>Encourager of Wickedneſs;</hi> Friends were not willing to hear <hi>Thomas Cam</hi> read Papers, to prove other men <hi>wicked,</hi> not preſent, becauſe the buſineſs of the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was to prove <hi>John Wilkinſon Wicked;</hi> and though 'tis not proper for one Friend to bring forth <hi>Accuſations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another Friend, in order to obtain a Judgment againſt the Accuſed behind his back, (which was the caſe of <hi>John Blaykling</hi> and twenty five more. Accuſers and Informers againſt <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John VVilkinſon,</hi> in order to have nine perſons choſen by thoſe Informers, to ſit in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> when they refuſed to own their Authority over them) yet if one, that hath profeſſed the truth, hath ſent abroad his Papers, having a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57559:286"/>tendency to put one Friend againſt another, about <hi>ſecuring Outward Eſtate,</hi> when he hath <hi>adviſed the like,</hi> and not only ſo, but hath made <hi>Lyes</hi> his Refuge, thereby abuſing honeſt men, that cannot ſubmit to his will, 'tis proper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for me, or any, that may have a Concern of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as I have) to diſcover the fruits of ſuch a Deceiving, Betraying Spirit, though behind the back of him, in whom it appears: But ſhould I chooſe nine perſons, and ſummon <hi>G. F.</hi> before them, as Judges over him, <hi>without his Aſſent,</hi> and if he would not own their Authority, proceed to accuſe and obtain ſuch Judges, to judge the matter, and ſpread that Judgment over a Nation, to his Defamation, <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> it would not add to my Credit, though I might quote nine (who have been taken to be of the party with <hi>G. F.</hi>) for a Preſident in the very like Caſe; and not only ſo, but might alſo quote ſeveral others, judging me, with reſpect to my Anſwer to <hi>G. F.</hi> without either hearing what I could ſay, to manifeſt the Reaſonableneſs of my ſo writing, or <hi>G. F.</hi> to plead his Innocency, to all the matters written by way of Reflection on him.</p>
                     <p>And whereas <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith, that I ſaid to <hi>Bray Dayly, that I ſent it</hi> (meaning my Anſwer) <hi>to</hi> G. F. <hi>three weeks before it was read in the Meeting;</hi> I ſay that's utterly falſe; 'tis probable I might acquaint him, 'twas written ſo long before, or left ſome time before with <hi>Charles Jones</hi> ſenior of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to be ſent to <hi>G. F.</hi> (for ſo I did) but he deſired more time to conſider, whether he would ſend it or no, than I was willing to grant.</p>
                     <p>Page 32th of <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Manuſcript he thus ſaith, <hi>Here it is evident thou haſt fulfilled my former words, that theſe thy pretended Queries were all of them real Charges, ſeeing here thou ſaiſt, thou firmly believeſt, that I am the Man, that hath been guilty of all theſe things <hi>before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned;</hi> and therefore, the leſs I do lake notice of them, becauſe I know them to be all Falſe and Malicious Charges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the words [<hi>All falſe</hi> and <hi>Malicious Charges,</hi>] I refer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57559:286"/>it to the Reader to conſider, whether there is not about five or ſix lyes more, whereof he may from thence be detected, and that from the view of his own <hi>Reply</hi> only, beſides that which may be termed Forgery, in adding to my words (<hi>viz. <hi>before-mentioned</hi>
                        </hi>) which words are none of mine, but his, and (as I take it) to render me to ſpeak what I neither thought, or intended. My firſt <hi>Query</hi> is about his <hi>ſtaying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a quarter of a year from Meeting,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>a very conſiderable time, though held in the very houſe of his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> this he denyes not, but pretends he was <hi>VVeak, ſo that the breath of People, ſitting near him, did overcome him;</hi> further adding theſe his very own words, <hi>viz. So that it was hard for me to ſit by any out of the Meeting, much more in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In my third <hi>Query</hi> it's thus ſaid; <q rend="margQuotes">"And yet art not thou ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that thou art the Man, that haſt adviſed the Rich to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure worldly Eſtate, that ſo the Perſecutors might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Spoilers thereof.</q> To this <hi>G. F.</hi> anſwers, <hi>Thou haſt not particularized any, though thou haſt generally charged me; and therefore, this is a groundleſs Accuſation and Calumny.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On this Query, I take occaſion to obſerve, that he is detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of ſeveral <hi>Lyes</hi> from the view of his own paper, if <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife may be properly termed the <hi>rich;</hi> and if they may not, I query of <hi>G.F.</hi> whether any among us may? The 1ſt <hi>Lye,</hi> whereof I take him on this occaſion, to be detectable, is, that he ſaith thus, <hi>Thou haſt not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culariſed any;</hi> when in my paper I had thus in particular queried, <q rend="margQuotes">"whether thou <hi>G.

                     </p>
                     <p>The 2d I take notice of, is theſe his words, <hi>Though thou
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57559:287"/>haſt generally charged me:</hi> To which I ſay, I did not; for I named not the <hi>Rich</hi> in general; and with this he charges me again in his Reply, in theſe words, <hi>viz. As thou goeſt over and over thy Paper of Falſe Charges, that I ſhould adviſe the Rich, in a <hi>general way,</hi> to ſecure their Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 3d I take notice of, on this occaſion, is from this word <hi>[groundleſs]</hi> when as he doth not deny, that he did ſo adviſe <hi>Mary Penington,</hi> ſignifying alſo, <hi>That if</hi> Mary Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington <hi>in her weakneſs did ſecure her Land for her, and her Children,</hi> &amp;c. yet what is this to thy making away thy Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> and ſo bids me, <hi>make what I can of it,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Hers was but a particular caſe;</hi> which leads me to obſerve thus much, that my <hi>Query</hi> was not <hi>Groundleſs,</hi> and ſo this may (as I take it) juſtly be termed the <hi>Third Lye,</hi> whereof he is detectable, from theſe his before-cited words, <hi>viz. Thou haſt not particularized any, though thou haſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally charged me, and therefore this is a groundleſs Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Calumny:</hi> But that which aggravates his Error the more, is his thus ſaying, <hi>I never adviſed thee to make away thy Eſtate, nor none elſe,</hi> as if <hi>Mary Penington</hi> was <hi>no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as to theſe his words, <hi>yet what is this to thy mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away thy Eſtate?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer and confeſs, that <hi>G. F.</hi> amongſt his many <hi>Lyes,</hi> hath written ſome <hi>Truth;</hi> for 'tis very true, 'tis nothing to the making away my Eſtate; doubtleſs it only ſecured their own, and not mine, neither was <hi>G. F.</hi> ever ſo friendly to me, as to take ſo much care of me and my family: beſides, on another ſcore, I may ſay, 'tis nothing to me, becauſe I never profeſt my ſelf principled to walk by other peoples <hi>outward Patterns;</hi> without knowing a better ground ſo to do, than a mere <hi>Outward Example,</hi> neither did I ſo do from any <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> given me, from <hi>G. F.</hi> or any Body elſe, and if any ſhall ſeem diſpleaſed at my uſing the word <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57559:287"/>on this occaſion; to be plain, I ſhall tell the Reader in ſhort, that I find <hi>G.F.</hi> in his Reply thus to ſay, on the very Occaſion relating to <hi>Mary Penington,</hi> viz. <hi>For ſometimes when people are weak and tender, and in trouble, they are to be left in ſome Caſes, which they cannot bear, as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe the Apoſtle ſaid concerning</hi> Dayes, <hi>&amp;c. but when they would make a ſect of it, and their Principle as thou doſt, then the Apoſtle judged them.</hi> On which words of <hi>George Fox,</hi> theſe neceſſary Obſervations may be made, if friends of truth are to be left in ſome caſes, then (according as I take G. F's Meaning to be) ſome body is to leave them; This ſome Body, in this Caſe, I take to be G. F. ſuppoſing himſelf inveſted with Power in ſome Caſes over Friends to leave them.</p>
                     <p>Here I am ſenſible the Reader may query, <hi>What are they to be left to?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, G. F. doth not, in ſo many words tell what; but yet 'tis plain his Meaning is (if it be juſt to meaſure his Meaning by his Words) not to leave them to their own; for then <hi>Mary Penington</hi> (in probability) would not have acted according to his Advice; becauſe G. F. in his Anſwer ſaith, <hi>He heard</hi> Mary <hi>ſay, She durſt not remove her Moveable Goods:</hi> and therefore I reaſonably ſuppoſe, that his further Meaning is, that he hath power to diſpenſe with Friends doing ſomething, contrary to what they (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Meaſure received) have Freedom in themſelves to do, which to me is further evidenced from the latter part of his words, which are theſe, <hi>But when they would make a Sect of it, and their Principle, as thou doſt, then the Apoſtle judged them.</hi> To which I ſay, he hath quoted no Scripture to prove his Aſſertion, and I affirm he is capable to quote none for proof, thus to write as a juſt Parallel in my Caſe; However his words ſerve Effectually to manifeſt unto me his Pride or Ignorance; for by theſe his words <hi>[make a Sect of it and their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple]</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57559:288"/>(compared with what I have already obſerved on this Occaſion) ſhews to me, that acting according to ones <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> (in ſome Caſes at leaſt) without an Allowance ſo to do from <hi>G. F.</hi> is worthy of <hi>Condemnation,</hi> which I take to be the Fruit of his Pride, or Ignorance; all which being conſidered, occaſions me to query of G. F. Whether 'tis not <hi>Deceit</hi> in him to inſinuate, as if <hi>Mary Peningtons</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing her Eſtate, was the <hi>Fruit of her Weakneſs,</hi> when it ſeems clearly to appear, that 'twas not only done in Perſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Advice, but alſo he himſelf confeſſeth in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That he heard</hi> Mary Penington <hi>ſay, ſhe durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move her Moveable Goods:</hi> And whether 'tis not the Fruit of great <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>reſpect of Perſons</hi> in G.F. to have ſo great a Regard to the <hi>Securing of her Eſtate</hi> for her and her Children; and yet take occaſion to Query, Whether the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that does ſo (meaning, <hi>Making away Eſtates,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for Fear of the Spoiler in time of Perſecution,</hi> &amp;c.) is not the Spirit of the World, that doth luſt to Envy, which is Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Senſual, and Deviliſh; which doubtleſs will be taken by ſome, to be intended by him as a Reflection on ſuch, as ſhould ſo do, without a Diſpenſation from him?</p>
                     <p>To be plain, If <hi>G. F.</hi> had ſo great a Care for <hi>others, not outwardly related to him,</hi> I know no Reaſon why I may not take the ſame Care for my <hi>VVife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> which are many, though I have no Diſpenſation from him ſo to do; and why he ſhould Condemn me for ſo doing, I underſtand not; unleſs he thinks my Care therein may prevent an <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blaſting,</hi> which ſome of his Temporizing party have Propheſied, will come upon me, and all that joyn to that Spirit, as they were pleaſed to Phraſe it.</p>
                     <p>In my 5th Query, it's thus ſaid, <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>And doſt thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that at a Quarterly-Meeting in</hi> Gloceſter-ſhire, (<hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after thy laſt departure from</hi> Briſtol) <hi>there was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that judged me not fit to judge in that Meeting,</hi> becauſe I had ſecured a part of my goods without Doors, <hi>(though I had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57559:288"/>left above two Hundred Pounds value of Moveable Goods, ſubject to the Spoilers beſides?) and doſt thou not remember, that none of the ſaid meeting declared any Approbation of his ſo doing, and that thou thy ſelf then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, manifeſted a diſlike thereof (as well as leveral others) after thy uſual manner thus,</hi> Whiſht Whiſht? <hi>Doſt thou not alſo remember, that I then ſignified to this effect,</hi> If what I had done was a crime, thoſe who were accounted of the chiefeſt amongſt us, were guilty of Crimes of the like nature?</q> This <hi>G. F.</hi> (in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereto) denies not, but in effect confeſſeth it, by theſe his words, <hi>But I did not ſay nothing elſe but <hi>whiſht, whiſht.</hi>
                        </hi> I now deſire the Reader to compare this with his before-cited words, <hi>viz. I know them to be all</hi> (meaning all my thirteen Queries before ſpoken of) <hi>Falſe and Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Charges;</hi> and then conſider, whether he hath not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in belyed his Conſcience at a large rate?</p>
                     <p>I now come to reckon with <hi>George Fox</hi> for his Anſwer to my 10th Query; a part whereof is, <q rend="margQuotes">"Whether 'tis fit for one that feeds of the fat of the Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that hath <hi>twelve or thirteen hundred pounds</hi> well ſecured out of the reach of the Spoilers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to admoniſh a company of Poor, Innocent, Harmleſs Friends, that have three or four Cows a piece, to feed themſelves and Children, not to ſecure them from the ſpoilers, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> if it be not fit for ſuch an one ſo to Admoniſh, I then Query, whether thou art not the man, that art ſo qualified, and who (in effect) haſt ſo admoniſhed?</q> To this, a part of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Anſwer is on this wiſe, <hi>The Lord knows, I had neither twelve, or thirteen hundred Pounds in my life, ſecured out of the Reach of the Spoiler. It's true I might have had ſomething in the other Powers dayes, that deſcended to me as my Birth-Right; but I gave it away to my Relations, not for fear of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or to make it away from the Spoilers.</hi> On this I obſerve, that he doth not deny, that he had <hi>twelve,</hi> or <hi>thirteen hundred Pounds;</hi> but he denies that he had ſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57559:289"/>much <hi>ſecured.</hi> And as to his ſpeaking of ſomething, that deſcended to him, as his Birth-Right; 'tis probable enough, that ſome, in Ages to come (comparing that with his not denying to have had <hi>twelve,</hi> or <hi>thirteen hundred Pounds,</hi> and that he gave not away what deſcended to him by Birth-Right for fear of Perſecution) may conclude, that he had ſome Eſtate by Birth-Right, which might be accounted worth <hi>twelve,</hi> or <hi>thirteen hundred Pounds;</hi> or at leaſt very conſiderable: But I cannot take that to beſpeak ſo much Credit and Repute to him, as a plain ſtating that matter would be; becauſe I can truly ſay (and ſo I believe many more can) That in his Perſon I accounted the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> fulfilled, who ſaid, <hi>God hath choſen the Fooliſh things of the World, to confound the Wiſe; and God hath choſen the Weak things of the World, to confound the Mighty; and Baſe things of the VVorld, and things which are Deſpiſed, hath God choſen; yea, and things which are not, to bring to Nought things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence:</hi> And partly on this ſcore, can I, in the fear of the Lord, ſay, (and that juſtly too) that he was to me (whilſt he kept his Place and Habitation in the Truth) truly Honourable; and therefore, I am perſuaded, that he would have added more to his Repute and Name, to have acquainted the Reader (if he would needs diſcourſe of his Birth-Right) that he deſcended of Poor Parentage, and that before he went abroad to preach the Light, he was a <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyman Shoemaker,</hi> and as ſuch an one, wrought Journy work with <hi>George Gee</hi> of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> (if he ſo did, as Report ſaith he did) and ſo have given <hi>Glory to God,</hi> that in years paſt, he made Choice of ſo poor, mean and deſpiſed a Perſon, through whom to preach the <hi>Everlaſting Light, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the Guide to the Father, and if <hi>G. F.</hi> had ever ſince he went abroad to Preach, laboured (whilſt able and at leiſure, with his hands, as the Primitive Apoſtles did) or otherwiſe been induſtrious in an <hi>Outward Calling,</hi> that the Goſpel of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57559:289"/>Chriſt might not be Chargeable, and ſo had gotten <hi>twelve, or thirteen hundred pounds,</hi> that alſo might have tended to his Repute, eſpecially, if inſtead of diſcourſing of that which deſcended unto him by Birth-Right, he had ſignified that out of the <hi>twelve, or thirteen hundred Pounds, he would take Care of his poor Relations, that ſo their Outward Man might be ſomewhat more Refreſht, and Comforted with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Food, Rayment and Living, than of late Years they have been, and that whilſt he was reputed to be in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all things needful as to Outward Enjoyments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Conſideration of theſe things, brings to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, <hi>G. F</hi>'s Language in another Caſe, and occaſions me to uſe the like; Poor <hi>George!</hi> I am forry for thee, and pitty thee; and one Reaſon amongſt many more, that I could now give, why on this Occaſion I ſo ſay, is this, I well remember the day was, and yet is, wherein I neither did, or do meaſure him according to the <hi>Nonſenſe of his Words,</hi> but the <hi>Intent</hi> and <hi>Meaning of his Mind;</hi> and yet his diſingenuity towards me, is ſo great, as that it appears, that one of his chiefeſt Defences for himſelf (next to a <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tongue</hi> and ſuffering <hi>Falſe Certificates</hi> to be made uſe of in his favour, (of which more anon) hath been to pervert ſound and undetectable words, to render his Friend guilty of ſo much Evil, as <hi>G. F.</hi> hath unjuſtly charged me with, rendring me intending that, which never was my Meaning, nor yet the Import of my Words, as plainly appears by his concluding, that all my <hi>Queries</hi> are <hi>Charges,</hi> though (as before is hinted) I would not have any think, I asked one <hi>Queſtion</hi> groundleſs, and that I accounted his Paper of <hi>Queries</hi> (which he terms an <hi>Epiſtle</hi>) to be in itſelf a good Exhortation. And ſince he writes that he gave away ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that deſcended to him by Birth-Right; I think it needful, on this Occaſion, to tell him, that it hath been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly Reported, that <hi>John Story</hi> hath been judged by him, or at leaſt by ſome of the Party with him, <hi>for giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57559:290"/>his Mother the Rent of a ſmall Eſtate, that his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave him; ſaying,</hi> John Story <hi>ſhould have kept the Eſtate in his own Hands, or at least got a Tenant that would not have paid Tithes, that ſo a Teſtimony might have been kept up againſt Tythes:</hi> Which occaſions me to query of <hi>G.F.</hi> (if he was concerned in this matter) whether he might not by that Rule, be worthy cenſure, for giving away ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that deſcended to him by Birth-Right, and whether it might not as well have been his duty to have kept the ſame, to have <hi>born a Teſtimony in the Caſe of Tythes,</hi> as well as <hi>John Story</hi>'s Duty ſo to have done?</p>
                     <p>In part of my twelfth <hi>Query,</hi> 'tis thus written, <q rend="margQuotes">"Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no a ſuffering for the Teſtimony of ſuch a <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> as <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> hath proved himſelf to be, as is manifeſt by his Propheſying <hi>John Story's Death within a year,</hi> and ſince expired, can be called a ſuffering for the Goſpel of Chriſt?</q> To the twelfth <hi>Query</hi> a part of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Anſwer is on this wiſe, <hi>Here is another of thy deceitful Queries;</hi> but where the <hi>Deceit</hi> lies, he doth not inform me, neither do I underſtand wherein he placeth the <hi>Deceit,</hi> eſpecially, ſince G. F. in his particular Anſwer thereto, doth not ſay, he was a true Prophet, but yet ſignifies thus much in his favour, <hi>That he would not have him made an Offender for words, ſince he acknowledged them;</hi> and this appears from G. F's own Words on this Occaſion, <hi>viz. And it is not right to make a man an Offender for Words, if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them; as I perceive,</hi> Solomon Eccles <hi>hath done.</hi> I now recommend the aforeſaid Query and Anſwer to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every Impartial Reader, doubting not but all ſuch will find <hi>George Fox</hi> detectable of another plain, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Lye, ſince he hath with reſpect to all my <hi>Queries,</hi> thus ſaid, as before is cited, <hi>I know them to be all Falſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicious Charges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a further Manifeſtation of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which led G. F. in his <hi>Reply</hi> to me, I think it needful to take further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57559:290"/>of thoſe his words, <hi>viz. And it is not right to make a man an Offender for words, if he acknowledge them.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs G. F. intended this as a Reproof to me, in terming <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Eccles</hi> a <hi>Falſe Prophet.</hi> What in and out babling is this! when he durſt not in Plain, Down-Right termes ſay, <hi>He was no Falſe Prophet;</hi> nor yet ſay, that <hi>he was on this Occaſion made an Offender for a Word by me;</hi> For if we ſay, <hi>It is not right to make a man an Offender for words, if he acknowledge them;</hi> the Meaning thereof in common ſenſe, and according to a <hi>Christian</hi> Spirit is this, that if a Man's <hi>Words</hi> expreſs not his <hi>Meaning,</hi> and he ſo declares, when he is charged therewith; Then if he ſay, <hi>that was not my Meaning,</hi> 'tis not right to inſiſt on a Man's Words in ſuch a Caſe, to make him an <hi>Offender;</hi> but what's this to <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> who after he had written, and given forth his Propheſie, to continue, as that which he would ſtand by, did not pretend that he had not expreſt himſelf according to his Meaning; and therefore the words of <hi>G. F.</hi> as aforeſaid, ſeem but a <hi>deceitful Contrivance to cover a Falſe Prophet.</hi> Moreover, 'tis obſervable, that G. F. doth not ſay, that <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> hath acknowledged, that <hi>his VVords were VVrong.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo to be noted, that the Words ſo ſpoken by G.F. in Relation to this <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> Solomon Eccles, ſeem to be grounded on the Words ſpoken by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29.21. <hi>That make a Man an Offender for a Word,</hi> which by the Scope of the ſaid Chapter, ſeems to relate unto the <hi>True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and hath been ſo expounded; and were not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>Defence</hi> for ſuch <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> as <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> hath proved himſelf to be, who thereby had offended many Brethren (eſpecially in the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> where he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd his <hi>Falſe Propheſie</hi>) who therefore on that Occaſion have had ſomething againſt him, which occaſions me to query of G. F. whether he did not approve of this <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi>'s going beyond the Sea, in the work of the Miniſtry?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57559:291"/>and if ſo, Whether he hath done well to encourage ſuch a <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> in ſuch a Service, until ſuch time that he had known, that he had been reconciled unto his Brethren, whom he had offended? But if <hi>G.</hi> F. ſhall deny, that he did Encourage him, I then ſay (for 'tis beſt to be plain) that ſuch a Denial is like to have little Place with me (whilſt G. F. appears, as of late he hath,) not only becauſe G. F. ſeems to publiſh <hi>Lyes</hi> (as it were by Heaps) but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis very improbable that he (who had ſo great an Eſteem for G. F. as to many is known he had) ſhould go in ſuch a Service without his Approbation.</p>
                     <p>However, ſuch a Denial may reaſonably occaſion an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Query, Whether G. F. hath been as induſtrious to bar the door againſt <hi>Solomon Eccles.</hi> in offering his <hi>Gift,</hi> as he and others have been againſt <hi>John Story</hi> and <hi>John VVilkinſon</hi>'s offering their Gift, though never proved to be <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> as ever we could underſtand?</p>
                     <p>One thing more is Remarkable on this Occaſion from G. F. his Words, before cited, <hi>viz. 'Tis not Right to make a Man an Offender for VVords, when he acknowledgeth them.</hi> Hence I take Occaſion to query, Whether ſince <hi>James Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> came to a Sight and Senſe of his Fall, and through <hi>true Repentance,</hi> and <hi>open Confeſſion</hi> before the Lord and his People, in many Parts of the Nation, found acceptance with the Lord and his People; I ſay whether 'twas not a wrong Spirit, that led <hi>George Fox</hi> to acquaint <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> in a Letter written <hi>Anno</hi> 1676. <hi>That they would become as hardned and as bad as the old Oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> amongſt whom he reckons up <hi>James Naylor,</hi> not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much Charity, as therewith alſo to acknowledge his being, through <hi>true Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Contrition of Heart,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: 'Tis well if the Reaſon thereof be not, becauſe <hi>James Naylor</hi> could never be brought by <hi>George Fox</hi> (as Report ſaith) to condemn theſe Words, or words to this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſpoken by him, I AM BUT A FIGURE OF ANO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57559:291"/>
                     <p>I now come to take notice of what <hi>G.F.</hi> ſaith to this my <hi>Query,</hi> 
                        <q rend="margQuotes">"whether thou G. F. did not adviſe <hi>Nathaniel Crips</hi> to <hi>buy his Tythes,</hi> &amp;c. if thou deny it, I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove it, or bring it under the hand of <hi>Nathaniel Crips</hi> that thou ſo did.</q> To this a Part of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Anſwer is on this wiſe; <hi>But for him to turn this, and ſay, I adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to buy his Tythes, he doth me a great deal of Wrong, and ſo he might have ſpared to impeach me Wrongfully.</hi> And in another Part of his Anſwer, thus; <hi>In the Morning I was walking in his Chamber, I ſaw this Spirit made ſome like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, that they mattered not what they ſaid, to blemiſh the Reputation of them, that wiſhed them well, both Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and Spiritually.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Word <hi>Temporally,</hi> 'tis rational to ſuppoſe, that G.

F. <hi>ſhould ſeem to deny this, and not his adviſing</hi> Mary Penington <hi>to ſecure her Eſtate, ſince here alſo he might have as well crept out (under the Notion, that Friends in ſome Caſes, when they are weak, are to be left;) as he did in the Caſe of</hi> Mary Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington.</p>
                     <p>To this I ſay, G. F. can beſt anſwer, however the <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ſhall have my thoughts, which <hi>are theſe,</hi> I think that <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Mary Penington</hi> had not of late ſo honourable and good an Eſteem for <hi>John Story,</hi> as Formerly, though they may for G. F. even as <hi>Nathaniel Crips</hi> hath of late been diſaffected with <hi>G. F</hi>'s Actions in ſome things, though not with <hi>John Story</hi>'s, ſo far as I know. Now if G. F. ſhould have denied the Matter relating to <hi>Mary Penington,</hi> it might have occaſioned the loſs of his Intereſt in her and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and (with them) in many more, becauſe they know
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57559:292"/>it to be Truth; and if he could have gotten <hi>Twenty Eight</hi> Perſons to have ſigned a <hi>Falſe Certificate,</hi> that he did not ſo adviſe; 'twould have had no more Credit with them, than the ſigning of the <hi>Falſe Certificate,</hi> hereafter following, by <hi>Twenty Eight</hi> hands (whoſe End therein I take to be, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his favour <hi>that, what I and many more, ſaw with our Eyes, was <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntrue</hi>) hath place with me, and ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, which is none at all: but G. F. having already (in great Meaſure, as I ſuppoſe, if not altogether) loſt his Intereſt in the heart of <hi>Nathaniel Crips,</hi> he, peradventure in that Caſe, ſcruples not to deny the Truth, and for ought I know, 'tis on this Confidence, that he can obtain a <hi>Falſe Certificate,</hi> under the hands of <hi>Twenty Eight</hi> Perſons, that he did not ſo, which though it might the more confirm <hi>Nathaniel Crips,</hi> that G. F. is wrong, yet many others might be the more confident that his <hi>Oppoſers are Wrong;</hi> and ſince the Import of his Anſwer implies a Denial, that he adviſed <hi>Nathaniel Crips to buy his Tythes,</hi> I think it needful here to cite, not only <hi>Nathaniel Crips</hi> his Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and Teſtimony in that Caſe, but alſo the Teſtimony of <hi>Robert Arch,</hi> in Relation to G.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57559:294"/>into the Orchard, and after I had walked a while with him, and asked him of the Affairs of Truth (for they had been many of them convinced by me before I was Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Cornwal</hi>) and there came another Young Man to us, and told us, <hi>The trained bands were riſing, and he heard, they would come and break up the Meeting;</hi> ſo one deſired me to walk over the Stile, it being, as I judged, about the eight hour, ſo I walked over into the corn fields, on the out ſide of the hedge, and one of the Young Men went from me, and of the Women, ſome walked in the Orchard, and ſome went to refreſh themſelves; and I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Young Man, <hi>VVhat time of the day it was?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Betwixt Eight and Nine:</hi> and I asked him, <hi>VVhat time the Meeting would come in?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>about Eleven or Twelve of the Clock:</hi> and I ſaid, <hi>If the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould come before that time, we might happen to get a good Meeting afterward:</hi> and the Man ſaid, <hi>They are Neighbours, and Civil People; if they ſhould come, they would hardly meddle:</hi> But after the Young Man went from me a matter of two Bow ſhots, he ſtood under the Hedge, waving his Hat to me, ſo I bid the other Young Man ſee what ailed him; ſo I kept my walking and they did not come at me again; and as I turned back to go round about the Orchard, there was a place I could ſee over the Hedge, the Souldiers were all over the Orchard; I heard ſay, ſome of the Souldiers did ſee me, but they were loth to meddle; ſo I being out in the open Fields, where they might eaſily ſee me, truly I did not go in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, for it was between nine or ten a Clock, and they ſwept the Barn, and got in Stools and Blocks. and we had a very large and bleſſed Meeting, till about Three of the Clock, and broke up our Meeting in the Power of God and in Peace; and afterwards the Woman of the Houſe being Dead, ſome deſired me to walk up to a Friends houſe about two Bowſhots off in our way, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57559:295"/>Friends went along with us, and I bad them bring up my Horſe thither, for I was to ride twenty Miles to one <hi>Fries</hi> houſe that Night, and ſo I went up to that houſe, and Friends went generally with me, and after we had refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves, we paſt away in Peace and Quietneſs, and no Souldiers at all came. And how can this be called a <hi>Fleeing in time of Perſecution?</hi> and that was a <hi>horrid Lye,</hi> that <hi>I hid my ſelf in a Ditch;</hi> there was (as I ſaw) but a Bank caſt up from a Lane, and I think it was a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket High-Way; and at this <hi>Fries</hi> Houſe, I had a Meeting, and there the Conſtables came to the Meeting; but News was brought, <hi>That their houſe was broke up;</hi> ſo they let us alone; and alſo I heard, that the Souldiers came after from <hi>Ringwood</hi> to the Houſe, when our Meeting was broke up, but we knew nothing of them, being gone before, and they never ſpake to me none of them about theſe things, theſe fourteen years; and in theſe Meetings the Glory of God was ſeen, and <hi>Fleeing in time of Perſecution,</hi> it was abhorred.</p>
                                    <p>And as for their ſaying, <hi>Some body ſpoke in</hi> Briſtol <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after I was gone down;</hi> I know nothing of that, but I came down to <hi>Joan Hilyes,</hi> and Friends were in the ſtreet, and came to me there, and I knew nothing, but they all came down: and if I had <hi>fled in time of Perſecution,</hi> I had not been in ſo many <hi>Goals</hi> and <hi>Priſons,</hi> but might have kept out of them; and yet this they ſay, <hi>Iohn Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he hath born the heat of the day; and</hi> George For, <hi>he hath fled in time of Perſecution.</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57559:296"/>Meeting ſhould then break up; and if ſo, no doubt, this in <hi>G. F.</hi> may as juſtly be termed <hi>Fleeing in time of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as the like action pretended to be done by another may: And to be very plain, I no way doubt, but that if a <hi>Falſe Witneſs-Bearer</hi> had wrongfully ſaid but thus much of <hi>John Story,</hi> as G. F. hath ſaid of himſelf, there would not have wanted a <hi>G.

                     <p>And now, though it be not ſo immediately my concern, to take notice of what he writes touching the Meeting at <hi>Ringwood,</hi> as that at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> yet ſince he hath made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and that 'tis (as I take it) the moſt he can ſpeak in his own favour, in relation to that Matter; I think it needful to make ſome Obſervations thereon, which are real <hi>Cauſe of Jealouſie,</hi> that G. F. was at that time led by ſuch a Spirit, as would have by him, and many of Party with him, been termed, <hi>The Spirit that ſeeks to ſave Self,</hi> had it but appeared in <hi>John Story.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> thing I take notice of, is theſe his Words, <hi>There came ten or twelve Women from Pool, who, in Probability, came with an Intention to come to a Meeting;</hi> and yet by <hi>G. F</hi>'s Relation, they came five or ſix Hours before the Meeting was to begin: whether this be probable, I ſhall at preſent leave to the ſenſe of others.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing I take Notice of, is this, <hi>G. F. walkt with a Young Man, and then there came another Young Man;</hi> this is <hi>Cauſe of Jealouſie</hi> that G. F. had a ſhifting kind of deſign, to take Young Men for his Companions, even as he did <hi>Edward Pyott</hi>'s Young Son <hi>Edward,</hi> and bid ſome, whom he calls <hi>Friends, Go their VVay;</hi> (how good they were in <hi>G. F</hi>'s eſteem is a queſtion, becauſe he tells us, they ſaid, <hi>Thou art more than a thouſand of us;</hi> and yet he doth not manifeſt his diſlike of their ſo ſaying) and after this he bad ſome (who are known to have been
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57559:297"/>antient, grave Friends) to walk by, becauſe many people were walking there.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing I take notice of, is this, that <hi>G. F.</hi> was for having a <hi>good Meeting after the Souldiers were gone,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>if the Souldiers ſhould come before that time, we might happen to get a good Meeting afterward;</hi> and though the Young Man ſaid in Anſwer, <hi>that the Souldiers were Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and civil People, and would hardly meddle;</hi> (which was an Encouragement to <hi>George Fox</hi> to ſtand in his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony) yet he kept ſtill walking in the Fields.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing I obſerve is this, <hi>that one of the Young Men went from him about two Bow ſhots under the Hedge, waving his Hat to</hi> G. F. this I may not term <hi>a Boy on top of a Hill, waving his Hat to Friends</hi> (ſpoken of by <hi>G. F.</hi> by way of Reflection on <hi>John Story,</hi> though denied by <hi>John Story,</hi> and by his Anſwers intended only (ſo far as I underſtand) to ſhew Friends the way to the Meeting) but <hi>a Boy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder a Hedge, waving his, Hat to</hi> George Fox; and, as may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, to keep him from Meeting, becauſe <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith, <hi>As I turned back to go round about the Orchard, there was a place I could ſee over the Hedge, the Souldiers were all over the Orchard; truly I did not go in among them:</hi> I ſhall now leave it to the Impartial Reader to conſider, whether if it were ſo, that any Friends when they met without doors, did, for Conveniency <hi>ſet a Boy on top of a Hill, to wave his Hat, to ſignifie the VVay Friends might paſs unto a good Meeting,</hi> be not more juſtifiable, than to <hi>have a Boy under a Hedge, to wave his Hat, to keep</hi> G. F. <hi>from Meeting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> thing I take notice of, is this; <hi>[That was a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Lye that I hid my ſelf in a Ditch;]</hi> for my own part. I cannot imagine wherein, from <hi>G. F</hi>'s own words, the <hi>horrid
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57559:298"/>Lye</hi> doth conſiſt, more than in ſaying, a <hi>[Ditch]</hi> when it ought to have been ſaid a <hi>[Bank]</hi> caſt up, which in Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is <hi>G. F</hi>'s miſtake; for 'tis well known, that in many places where <hi>Banks</hi> are caſt up in the Country, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a <hi>Ditch;</hi> however, 'tis obſervable, that his words cannot reaſonably be taken to import a Denial, <hi>that he hid himſelf behind a <hi>Bank.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> thing I take notice of, is this, <hi>That the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke up about three of the Clock, and that he went not into the houſe where the Meeting was, but to another, two Bowſhots off, and ſtayed to refreſh himſelf;</hi> and yet rode <hi>twenty miles that Night,</hi> which is not very common for G. F. to do, as ever I could underſtand, after a Meeting broke up ſo late.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> thing I take notice of, is this, that though as to that Meeting at <hi>Ringwood</hi> (if Report be true) there are many notorious Circumſtances, to ſhew him a <hi>Fleer in time of Perſecution,</hi> yet I obſerve he makes mention but of one particular thing, that he ſaith is a <hi>Lye</hi> or <hi>Falſe,</hi> and that is before ſignified, which I take to be no more than ſaying <hi>[in a Ditch]</hi> inſtead of <hi>[behind a Bank]</hi> which to me is a Demonſtration, that he could not in Truth deny other things reported of him on this Occaſion, which puts me in mind thus farther to ſay, that if inſtead of telling <hi>that they ſwept the Barn,</hi> &amp;c. he had named the <hi>Hour</hi> when he came in the Meeting, as well as when the <hi>Meeting broke up;</hi> and that he did not adviſe the Friends to gather together, and then be gone from them, until the Souldiers were gone, that ſo he might come and ſtay a little while amongſt them, and then be gone twenty miles that night, to be ſure to be far enough out of their reach; it might have made his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony look with a better face, eſpecially if he had had ſo much Patience as to have gone into the houſe, after Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57559:298"/>to viſit the <hi>Diſtreſſed Family,</hi> the <hi>VVoman</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>being dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude my <hi>Obſervations</hi> herein, I thus ſay; That I firmly believe, 'twould have tended more to <hi>G. F</hi>'s Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, plainly to have confeſt, <hi>that at Times and Seaſons he hath contrived to ſave himſelf, and keep out of the reach of Perſecutors; than after he hath ſo done, to cover the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by ſuch ſort of Diſcourſes, as theſe now manifeſted are;</hi> wherein his Weakneſs and Confuſion, doth ſo appear, as cannot but be obvious to every Impartial and Judicious Reader.</p>
                     <p>And now foraſmuch as <hi>John Ward</hi> and twenty ſeven more, have given forth a certificate intending thereby to clear G.F. I thought it needful to add that alſo, that ſo nothing that may be pretended <hi>would have favoured his Cauſe,</hi> might be omitted by me, the ſaid Certificate now follows.</p>

                     <p>They ſay, that I have charged <hi>George Fox</hi> to be <hi>one of the greateſt Fleers in time of Perſecution, of any that I
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57559:300"/>know profeſſing the Truth, and accounted by others a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend:</hi> Herein they, as I take it, (and as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, all Impartial Readers will,) <hi>falſly charge me;</hi> my Words were theſe, <hi>And, if Report be true, this is but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little of what might at large be manifeſted to prove him one of the greatest Fleers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in time of Perſecution, that ever I knew, profeſſing the Truth, and eſteemed by others a Faithful Friend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3dly, They ſay, that I, for Confirmation thereof, brought an Inſtance of a Meeting here at <hi>Brastol,</hi> which <hi>George Fox</hi> was preſent at, about 15 years ſince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this alſo cannot be taken to be a true Charge from my words, not only be cauſe I did not poſitively charge him to be <hi>one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Fleers in time of Perſecution,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo becauſe I did not ſignifie the <hi>Time</hi> at which the <hi>Meeting was held,</hi> though they ſay, 'twas about 15 years ſince; and ſo it appears, that they are detected of ſeveral Lies, by comparing their Teſtimony with what I have written. This occaſions me to obſerve, that they do not ſay, <hi>they never knew or could remember, that he ſtept down, and haſtned out of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at a Back-pair of Stairs,</hi> which is the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I charge him with the ſight of mine own Eyes, and others alſo on this Occaſion. And this alſo I know, that his ſo Departure was a very conſiderable time before the Meeting broke up; and were it not ſo, that theſe <hi>Falſe Witneſs-Bearers</hi> were conſcious to themſelves, that about fifteen years ſince <hi>George Fox</hi> ſo did, (as I ſaid my Eyes were witneſs of) what reaſon ſhould they have for limiting my Charge to that time?</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now leave it to the Conſciences of all Impartial Readers to conſider, whether <hi>John Ware</hi> and the other twenty ſeven Perſons, do not juſtly deſerve the title of <hi>Falſe-Witneſs-Bearers,</hi> and not only ſo, but ſince <hi>George Fox,</hi> in his Anſwer to me, hath ſignified on this Occaſion, <hi>that he believes there are many in</hi> Briſtol, <hi>that will witneſs againſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57559:300"/>this Falſe Charge,</hi> it be not rational to ſuppoſe, that the aforeſaid <hi>John VVare</hi> and the other twenty ſeven Subſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, have been by him betrayed to affirm whereof they know not, and yet notwithſtanding, their Teſtimony is lame, and not ſufficient to ſerve his turn, not only for the Reaſons aforeſaid, but alſo becauſe they do not ſo much as affirm, that the Meeting, held about fifteen years ſince, was in the <hi>time of Perſecution,</hi> and that he ſtaid therein until the Meeting ended.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">By <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Rule, thoſe who matter not what they ſay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are exerciſed by this Spirit, that made ſome like <hi>Devils,</hi> witneſs his before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited words, ſpoken as he was walking in <hi>Nathaniel Crips</hi> his Chamber, which occaſions me to query from his words <hi>[all Falſe and Malicious Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es]</hi> Whether by his own Rule he hath not manifeſted himſelf to be exerciſed by the ſame Spirit? for had he been a man that had taken Care to have affirmed nothing but the truth, he would not have been the Publiſher (as well as Author) of ſo many <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Falſhoods,</hi> whereof to his ſhame he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.</note> all Falſe, Malicious Charges, whenas he hath not only written <hi>ſix Sheets</hi> of Paper (for the Copy delivered me, contains ſo many) by way of Anſwer, which is a tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice thereof at a large rate; but alſo it appears that many of them, which by his general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion he accounts <hi>Falſe Charges,</hi> are not in his particular Anſwers <hi>denied to be true,</hi> but rather an <hi>owning</hi> thereof, is plainly implied from his words, as is already ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; this I take to be one ſign or Token, that <hi>the Word of the Lord by his Servant</hi> John Wilkinſon <hi>is fulfilling.</hi>

                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57559:301"/>
                     <p>I now come to take notice, that G. F. accuſeth me, <hi>that I threatned the Constables at their Perils, not to meddle with any thing of mine within doors,</hi> &amp;c. This I ſay is a <hi>Falſe Charge;</hi> my words on that Occaſion were to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the <hi>Door is open, the Goods in the houſe are mine, they might go in, and there was enough;</hi> but then I alſo told them, <hi>That if they did meddle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>before I ſpoke with the Juſtice, I ſhould lay that Injuſtice at their Doors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of right I ought to be firſt heard, before my Goods ought to be diſtrained,</hi> and though <hi>G.

                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus far, with reſpect to particular matters, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Conſcience, I have this further in ſhort to ſay, That ſhould I trace <hi>G. F</hi>'s Anſwer after the ſame Method, as he hath done mine, I account that <hi>Thirty Sheets of Paper</hi> would not contain ſuch an Anſwer, and might tend to endleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and therefore I chuſe the rather to give the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but a taſt of that Spirit, from whence his bundle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Falſhoods do proceed. And in the mean time ſhall add this Query, Whether or no, ſince G. F. hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo many <hi>Lyes,</hi> as aforeſaid, that are detectable from the ſight of his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and compared with my <hi>Paper</hi> (which was an Anſwer to his queries) it may not be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to conclude, that he hath taken ſuch a Liberty to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as at ſome times and ſeaſons to ſay any thing (Right or Wrong) to clear himſelf, and defame others, that cannot be ſubject to his Will?</p>
                     <p>I now come to take notice of a <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> written by G. F. in theſe words, <hi>Here follows the Epiſtle that hath ſo touched</hi> William Rogers <hi>which he makes all this Work and VVriting about, who would make me inconſiſtent with my ſelf; and ſo he might have done the Apoſtle, who one while</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57559:301"/>Circumciſed; <hi>and then again</hi> forbid it: <hi>and one while ſaid,</hi> They ſhould not Judge one another about dayes, and meats and drinks, <hi>and afterward</hi> Judged them for it, who made it their Principle. <hi>But in</hi> William Roger<hi>'s Charges, he hath not proved me inconſiſtent with my ſelf, but rather himſelf is inconſiſtent with what he was formerly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I thus Anſwer, Theſe few lines do manifeſt to me, that G. F. doth not divide and diſtinguiſh as he ought to do, if he be not ignorant of the Scriptures, and of what I have written; and of what his name is too: The Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof leads me to obſerve, that he hath not quoted any Scripture, whereby he pretends to prove his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and ſo no need to write very large for <hi>Diſproof</hi> of that, which he pretends not to <hi>prove;</hi> yet for the ſakes of ſome on this Occaſion I ſhall thus add, That the Scripture no where teſtifies, that the Apoſtle did <hi>forbid Circumciſion in the ſame Caſe where he practiſed Circumciſion;</hi> and that when the Apoſtle ſaid any thing to this purpoſe, by way of Exhortation to any amongſt the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>that they ſhould not judge one another about Dayes and Meats and Drinks,</hi> it was (as I have always taken it) with a tender Regard only to ſuch who made <hi>Conſcience</hi> (which could not be unleſs they were principled) either to <hi>obſerve</hi> or <hi>not to obſerve a Day, Meats</hi> or <hi>Drinks;</hi> and ſuch the Apoſtle (when they acted from a Principle ſo to do) at no time judged (as ever from the Scriptures of Truth, I could underſtand) though in the <hi>Obſervations</hi> of ſome things le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, not having ſo far received the Spirit, as to be led there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; and yet <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith, <hi>And afterward judged them for it, who made it their Principle;</hi> as if the day was, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>they might obſerve a day, when they were not principled ſo to do;</hi> but when they became <hi>principled to obſerve a day, then it became Sin and Matter worthy of Judgment and Condemnation by the Apoſtle;</hi> and not only ſo, but as if act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to ones Principle, in <hi>Matters of Conſcience,</hi>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:57559:302"/>were Condemnable, when practiſing things <hi>not according to ones Principle, in matters of Conſcience</hi> might be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This I dare not conclude to have ever been the Apoſtle's Meaning; but I am well ſatisfied is agreeable to the Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of <hi>G. F.</hi> (or ſome taken to be of his Adherents, who have publiſht their Papers and Judgments againſt many) and the real Cauſe (as to me is evident) is becauſe they are found, practiſing according to <hi>their Principle,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act (for fear of Threats and Frowns of Man) againſt it.</p>
                     <p>And foraſmuch as <hi>G. F.</hi> hath made uſe of the aforeſaid Inſtance, relating to <hi>Circumciſion, Days, Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> on ſuch wife, as if the <hi>Practice</hi> or <hi>not Practiſing</hi> of ſuch things, were grounded meerly on the <hi>Apoſtle's Permiſſion,</hi> and ſo by that Example, <hi>G. F.</hi> may do the like; I think it needful to add, that when Contention aroſe about the <hi>Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of Circumciſion,</hi> Acts 15. it doth not appear that the Apoſtles aſſumed to themſelves <hi>a Power to permit</hi> or <hi>not to permit,</hi> nor yet to judge the Caſe <hi>Without the Aſſent of Parties differing;</hi> for it appears the <hi>differing Parties</hi> agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about that Queſtion, and at that time, the Apoſtles did agree, <hi>That Circumciſion was not fit to be laid on the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>which were Believers</hi> (who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were principled to practiſe the ſame) neither did they endeavour to oblige thoſe who practiſed Circumciſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they believed, to forbear the ſame, before by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they were led from it; and the Reaſon hereof (undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly) was, becauſe 'twas ſafeſt both for <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> to act <hi>according to Faith,</hi> that ſo they might not ſin: for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin;</hi> which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion anſwers to the Light of Chriſt in the Conſcience at this day, as well as is agreeable to the Apoſtle's Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</p>
                     <p>And now that the meaning of the Apoſtle, as to the matter relating to <hi>Circumciſion, Dayes, Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> may be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57559:302"/>a little further explained, I think it needful to cite a Paſſage out of my Manuſcript in anſwer to Part of <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Book of <hi>Government,</hi> which may be pertinent on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">
                        <p>"We find that many of the Believing <hi>Jews</hi> were not come from under Circumciſion, and that thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſaw beyond it, did not condemn ſuch their Brethren; but we do not find that the Apoſtles (as perſons that had Power to <hi>permit</hi> or <hi>not permit</hi> ſuch a Practice in the Church) did <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> of it in any of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Condemn</hi> the ſame in ſuch as practiſed it, until by Faith they ſaw beyond it; for, as on the one hand, 'twas not in their Commiſſion to preach up <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> ſo on the other hand, 'twas not in their Power to be a Bond on any to forbear, who through Faith were not firſt led therefrom.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall now leave it to the Conſciences of unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Readers, whether what G. F. hath ſaid touching <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> and <hi>Obſervation</hi> of <hi>Dayes, Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> is ſufficient to juſtifie his adviſing <hi>Mary Penington</hi> to ſecure her Eſtate from the Spoilers <hi>(when ſhe durſt not remove her moveable goods, nor made it as her principle)</hi> and <hi>condemn others that are principled ſo to do;</hi> querying of ſuch, Whether 'tis not from the Spirit of the World, that luſteth to Envy?</p>
                     <p>With this Teſtimony I ſhall conclude this my reply to G.

                        <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> which by the Way puts me in remembrance thus to premiſe, That though G.

And now to proceed:</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>John Blaykling's Postſcript,</hi> I find it contains about a <hi>Sheet of Paper,</hi> which thus begins, <hi>Here followeth the Teſtimony and Certificate from</hi> John Blaykling, <hi>to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Aſperſions that</hi> William Rogers <hi>and others would caſt upon</hi> George Fox, <hi>as afore-mentioned.</hi> Therein he gives a large Teſtimony for <hi>George Fox,</hi> as a man that <hi>renders not Evil for Evil, that's bleſſed with Honour above many Brethren,</hi> and <hi>that thouſands will ſtand by him in an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Record unto the Integrity of his Soul to Truth, that ſtill lives with him; that his Life reigns, and is Spotleſs, Innocent, and ſtill retains his Integrity, whoſe Eternal Honour and Bleſſed Renown ſhall remain; yea, his Preſence and the Droping of his Tender VVords in the Lord's Love,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57559:304"/>was my Souls Nouriſhment.</hi> On which I obſerve, that if thoſe thouſands are ſuch as <hi>John Blaykling, John Ware</hi> and the <hi>twenty ſeven</hi> other perſons, that ſigned the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Falſe Certificate,</hi> they will never add by that Spirit that led them ſo to teſtifie (as aforeſaid) unto his nor their own Credit; and though in a Dark Spirit, they may term it an <hi>Heavenly Record,</hi> yet I teſtifie, ſuch a <hi>Record</hi> can never bear date from <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe <hi>nothing that maketh a Lye can therein enter.</hi>

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57559:304"/>as that it hath been a great <hi>Concern of Conſcience</hi> to me, for ſeveral years paſt, both by Word and Writing, to contend earneſtly for the Exaltation of <hi>Christ's Government in the hearts of Believers,</hi> which is clearly manifeſted by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of what I have written in Anſwer to a part of <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s Book of <hi>Government,</hi> my <hi>Postſcript</hi> to my <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of Paſſages</hi> at <hi>Drawel,</hi> my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns</hi> (ſo termed) <hi>Narrative</hi> after the Meeting at <hi>Drawel,</hi> ſeveral of my <hi>Letters</hi> to <hi>George Fox,</hi> the <hi>Diſſatisfactions</hi> ſubſcribed by ſeveral (as well as my ſelf) at <hi>Briſtol, Anno</hi> 1677. and in divers other Papers, in the giving forth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I have been concerned ſince that day, wherein it hath evidently appeared, that ſuch as cannot be ſubject to ſome <hi>Outward Orders,</hi> or <hi>Preſcriptions,</hi> given forth by <hi>George, Fox</hi> or ſome others, aſſuming Authority ſo to do, <hi>are judged and condemned for refuſing ſubmiſſion, without true regard to a Conſciencious Scruple;</hi> as if the exaltation of <hi>Chriſt's Government in the heart,</hi> conſiſted in <hi>Conformity to other mens lines made ready to our hands;</hi> a lively Inſtance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be eaſily diſcerned by thoſe who ſhall peruſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Articles of <hi>Accuſation,</hi> drawn up againſt <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi> and <hi>John Story,</hi> and proceedings in Relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, both before and after the <hi>four dayes Meeting</hi> at <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> eſpecially if compared with the Paper given forth from <hi>Ellis Hook</hi>'s Chamber, dated the 12th of the 4th Month 1677, ſubſcribed by <hi>Charles Marſhal</hi> and 65 perſons more, and the Anſwers thereunto, all which are recorded in the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> firſt made mention of in the Preface to the 1ſt <hi>Part of the Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> ready for peruſal of any Friend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to view the ſame.</p>
                     <p>In the ſenſe of theſe things can I truly ſay, that my heart is even melted before the Lord, that Iniquity ſhould grow to ſo high a pitch, in any that are Profeſſors of Truth, as to write at ſo wicked and ungodly a rate, as <hi>John Blayk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> hath done, and yet bring forth nothing that doth in

                     <p>In order hereunto, I ſay, I have diligently peruſed his <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> ſeveral times over, on purpoſe to notifie every particular Matter of Fact, which in his or any ones ſenſe I did ſuppoſe, might be accounted <hi>Evil,</hi> and do not find more than theſe two particulars following here cited, word for word, out of <hi>John Blaykling's Poſtſcript.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is on this wiſe, <hi>And as to that particular</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection <hi>caſt upon him, which</hi> William Rogers, (<hi>if his</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation <hi>be an</hi> Affirmation <hi>of the Matter</hi>) <hi>would ground an</hi> Accuſation <hi>upon,</hi> viz. Art not thou the man that haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Liberty to ſtay almoſt a Quarter of a year from Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? and did not <hi>John Blaykling,</hi> by name, manifeſt his Burthen and Exerciſe of ſpirit on thine, and the truths behalf for thy ſo doing? [and having thus repeated my words, he proceeds and ſaith] <hi>I anſwer, if</hi> William Rogers <hi>affirm, that I had a burthen on my Spirit, with reſpect to</hi> George Fox, as out of God's Counſel in that matter, or as departing from the Truth, <hi>I do teſtifie, that he affirms an</hi> Untruth, <hi>and that it doth ariſe in him from a Spirit of Envy, watching for Evil against the Innocent, whom God juſtifies.</hi>

                     <p>On this I obſerve, that <hi>John Blaykling</hi> cannot lay all his general and groſs Reflections at my Door on that account, becauſe he himſelf doth not take it to be a Charge, unleſs my <hi>Interogation</hi> be an <hi>affirmation,</hi> which he doth not there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be, neither did I ever intend it ſo; yet 'tis ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to conclude from the aforeſaid words of <hi>John Blayk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> that I had ground ſo to query; and therefore I now appeal unto God's Witneſs in all Conſciences, whether <hi>John
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57559:305"/>Blaykling</hi> be not found <hi>contradicting himſelf,</hi> ſince in his <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> he thus ſaith, <hi>Is this the Shift you are put to, that he</hi> (meaning <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi>) <hi>ſhould not be found a Falſe Prophet, to charge a Lye upon me to defame the Innocent withal?</hi> meaning (as may reaſonably be taken) with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to what I query, as aforeſaid, with relation to <hi>him</hi> and <hi>George Fox,</hi> which to me is an Evidence, that the <hi>Word of the Lord</hi> by <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> is fulfilling, ſince it appears, as aforeſaid, that my Query was not groundleſs, and that <hi>George Fox</hi> accounts it a <hi>Falſe Charge.</hi> And though <hi>John Blaykling</hi> proceeds to query, <hi>doth not the Lord confound you in all your undertakings?</hi> yet there appears to me no Ground for his ſo querying, but rather that his and <hi>G. F</hi>'s Confuſion, to their Shame, is abundantly manifeſted, from what may be viſible to every Impartial, Underſtanding Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that will be at the pains to compare all written by <hi>George Fox, John Blaykling</hi> and <hi>my ſelf</hi> on this Occaſion, without other proofs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> particular matter of Fact laid by <hi>John Blayk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to my Charge, is on this wiſe, <hi>And whereas</hi> William Rogers <hi>asks,</hi> if <hi>George Fox</hi> would not have accounted this in another, the Fruit of a Careleſs, Slothful, Libertine or Dark Spirit, that was either departed, or departing from the Truth, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> implicitly thereby charging him with it [To which <hi>John Blaykling</hi> thus ſaith] <hi>Might not</hi> William Rogers <hi>have applied this at home, who knows in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience what a Libertine, Looſe and Dark Spirit, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Subjection to the Truth, he hath given way to, and hath taken a Liberty to himſelf to make away his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſtate, or at leaſt a conſiderable part of it, to avoid ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thereby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On this I obſerve, that as to this particular, with reſpect to <hi>ſecuring a part of my Eſtate,</hi> Jo. Blaykling cannot lay all his prophane and wicked Charges againſt me at my door on that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57559:306"/>account, without contradiction to his large Teſtimony for <hi>George Fox,</hi> as a man that is <hi>ſpotleſs and ſtill keeping his Integrity;</hi> becauſe <hi>George Fox</hi> denies not (as before is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted) that he adviſed <hi>Mary</hi> the Wife of <hi>Iſaac Pening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, to ſecure her or their Eſtate, from the hands of the Spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My laſt <hi>Obſervation</hi> is on <hi>John Blaykling</hi>'s beginning of his <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> by which it appears to me, that one of his ends was to appear thus publick, as a witneſs on behalf of <hi>George Fox,</hi> to clear all <hi>Aſperſions, that my ſelf and others had caſt on him,</hi> as afore mentioned, and indeed he hath done it excellently well, if teſtifying that <hi>G. F.</hi> is <hi>ſpotleſs,</hi> without entring into the Merit of Matters of Fact, be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof; but if not, his Teſtimony and Certificate is, for the moſt part, of no Credit. However it occaſions me to note what <hi>Irreligious Confidence</hi> attends him, thus to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as a Witneſs to clear <hi>G. F.</hi> of many things he knows nothing of; for <hi>John Blaykling</hi> was not with <hi>George Fox</hi> at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and with <hi>Nathaniel Crips,</hi> when Occaſion of <hi>Nathaniel Crips</hi> his Charge touching G. F<hi>'s adviſing him to buy his Tythes</hi> was taken; and yet <hi>John Blaykling</hi>'s Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate (as by the Scope thereof doth plainly appear to me) is to clear G.F. from all Aſperſions whatſoever, or from whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: To be plain, ſuch Attempts are a Shame and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to Religion, and are an Abhorrency to men of common and moral Honeſty: but 'tis to be doubted, that ſince that day, wherein <hi>John Blaykling, Robert Barrow</hi> and two others, gave it under their hands, in a Letter to Friends at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, That they by the Authority of God's power have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding given them of God to act and determine in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs appertaining to the Goſpel and its Order;</hi> John Blayk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath been ſo puft up with ſpiritual Pride, as that the Lord hath ſuffered his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to be turned into <hi>Folly,</hi> and his <hi>Zeal</hi> into <hi>Envy,</hi> whereby he now is (as well as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hath been, in another Caſe relating to <hi>John Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:57559:306"/>ſo dexterous in giving forth a <hi>Falſe Certificate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now to conclude, I recommend the whole to the Righteous Witneſs of God in all Conſciences, nothing doubting, but that the Lord will yet more and more ariſe, to oppoſe that <hi>prophane ungodly Spirit,</hi> which thus ſtrives againſt his Heritage, making <hi>Lyes, Falſe Certificates, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Slanders</hi> and <hi>Reproaches,</hi> as the chief Inſtruments, to take away the <hi>Good Name</hi> and Reputation of ſuch, as cannot bow to the <hi>Will of Man,</hi> nor leave the way of the Spirit of Life, wherein they have begun, in Expectation to be made perfect through <hi>Conformity to Outward Ordinances,</hi> knowing this, <hi>that thoſe who have begun in the Spirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made perfect by the Fleſh.</hi>

F.</hi> hath a Conſcience to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade an Anſwer hereunto, becauſe he will not fairly (as in truth he ought to do) acknowledge, that if the import of his own words may be taken to be ſound, he is thereby detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of a practice neither Humane, Civil, Moral or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: Then we further query, Whether 'twas not abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Wickedneſs for him to render <hi>William Rogers</hi> a <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Agreement,</hi> that was written down at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> by which he is rendred a <hi>Breaker of his Covenant under hand,</hi> upon Report that a Narrative of Paſſages, at the Meetings at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> were ſpread, whenas he neither pretended to be informed, what <hi>particular Matters</hi> were contained in thoſe Papers, nor yet to which of the Meetings they did relate; for touching ſome Meetings, there was no agreement made under-hand as to their Order, though there was to ſome other; but yet not one word of Covenant or Agreement, that any perſon ſhould be obliged, not to ſend abroad a Narrative, whether it might relate to all, any, or either of the Meetings; and ſo conſequently his rendring <hi>William Rogers</hi> to be a <hi>Breaker of his Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. is certainly far ſhort of Civility, Humanity, Morality and Common Honeſty, if <hi>G.
